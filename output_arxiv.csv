"Counterfactual reasoning: Do language models need world knowledge for causal understanding?","Jiaxuan Li, Lang Yu and Allyson Ettinger",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03278","Current pre-trained language models have enabled remarkable improvements in downstream tasks, but it remains difficult to distinguish effects of statistical correlation from more systematic logical reasoning grounded on understanding of the real world. In this paper we tease these factors apart by leveraging counterfactual conditionals, which force language models to predict unusual consequences based on hypothetical propositions. We introduce a set of tests drawn from psycholinguistic experiments, as well as larger-scale controlled datasets, to probe counterfactual predictions from a variety of popular pre-trained language models. We find that models are consistently able to override real-world knowledge in counterfactual scenarios, and that this effect is more robust in case of stronger baseline world knowledge -- however, we also find that for most models this effect appears largely to be driven by simple lexical cues. When we mitigate effects of both world knowledge and lexical cues to test knowledge of linguistic nuances of counterfactuals, we find that only GPT-3 shows sensitivity to these nuances, though this sensitivity is also non-trivially impacted by lexical associative factors.","No"
"Cheater's Bowl: Human vs. Computer Search Strategies for Open-Domain Question Answering","Wanrong He, Andrew Mao, Jordan Boyd-Graber",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03296","For humans and computers, the first step in answering an open-domain question is retrieving a set of relevant documents from a large corpus. However, the strategies that computers use fundamentally differ from those of humans. To better understand these differences, we design a gamified interface for data collection -- Cheater's Bowl -- where a human answers complex questions with access to both traditional and modern search tools. We collect a dataset of human search sessions, analyze human search strategies, and compare them to state-of-the-art multi-hop QA models. Humans query logically, apply dynamic search chains, and use world knowledge to boost searching. We demonstrate how human queries can improve the accuracy of existing systems and propose improving the future design of QA models.","No"
"Fine-Grained Emotional Paraphrasing along Emotion Gradients","Justin Xie",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03297","Paraphrase generation, a.k.a. paraphrasing, is a common and important task in natural language processing. Emotional paraphrasing, which changes the emotion embodied in a piece of text while preserving its meaning, has many potential applications, e.g., moderating online dialogues and preventing cyberbullying. We introduce a new task of fine-grained emotional paraphrasing along emotion gradients, that is, altering the emotional intensities of the paraphrases in fine grain following smooth variations in affective dimensions while preserving the meanings of the originals. We propose a framework for addressing this task by fine-tuning text-to-text Transformers through multi-task training. We enhance several widely used paraphrasing corpus by annotating the input and target texts with their fine-grained emotion labels. With these labels, fine-tuning text-to-text Transformers on these corpus entails multi-task training. Evaluations of the fine-tuned Transformers on separate test sets show that including fine-grained emotion labels in the paraphrase task significantly improve the chance of obtaining high-quality paraphrases of the desired emotions, i.e., more than doubling the number of exact matches of desired emotions while achieving consistently better scores in paraphrase metrics such as BLEU, ROGUE, and METEOR.","No"
"KATSum: Knowledge-aware Abstractive Text Summarization","Guan Wang, Weihua Li, Edmund Lai, Jianhua Jiang",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03371","Text Summarization is recognised as one of the NLP downstream tasks and it has been extensively investigated in recent years. It can assist people with perceiving the information rapidly from the Internet, including news articles, social posts, videos, etc. Most existing research works attempt to develop summarization models to produce a better output. However, advent limitations of most existing models emerge, including unfaithfulness and factual errors. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named as Knowledge-aware Abstractive Text Summarization, which leverages the advantages offered by Knowledge Graph to enhance the standard Seq2Seq model. On top of that, the Knowledge Graph triplets are extracted from the source text and utilised to provide keywords with relational information, producing coherent and factually errorless summaries. We conduct extensive experiments by using real-world data sets. The results reveal that the proposed framework can effectively utilise the information from Knowledge Graph and significantly reduce the factual errors in the summary.","No"
"JamPatoisNLI: A Jamaican Patois Natural Language Inference Dataset","Ruth-Ann Armstrong, John Hewitt and Christopher Manning",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03419","JamPatoisNLI provides the first dataset for natural language inference in a creole language, Jamaican Patois. Many of the most-spoken low-resource languages are creoles. These languages commonly have a lexicon derived from a major world language and a distinctive grammar reflecting the languages of the original speakers and the process of language birth by creolization. This gives them a distinctive place in exploring the effectiveness of transfer from large monolingual or multilingual pretrained models. While our work, along with previous work, shows that transfer from these models to low-resource languages that are unrelated to languages in their training set is not very effective, we would expect stronger results from transfer to creoles. Indeed, our experiments show considerably better results from few-shot learning of JamPatoisNLI than for such unrelated languages, and help us begin to understand how the unique relationship between creoles and their high-resource base languages affect cross-lingual transfer. JamPatoisNLI, which consists of naturally-occurring premises and expert-written hypotheses, is a step towards steering research into a traditionally underserved language and a useful benchmark for understanding cross-lingual NLP.","No"
"A Generative Approach for Script Event Prediction via Contrastive Fine-tuning","Fangqi Zhu, Jun Gao, Changlong Yu, Wei Wang, Chen Xu, Xin Mu, Min Yang, Ruifeng Xu",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03496","Script event prediction aims to predict the subsequent event given the context. This requires the capability to infer the correlations between events. Recent works have attempted to improve event correlation reasoning by using pretrained language models and incorporating external knowledge~(e.g., discourse relations). Though promising results have been achieved, some challenges still remain. First, the pretrained language models adopted by current works ignore event-level knowledge, resulting in an inability to capture the correlations between events well. Second, modeling correlations between events with discourse relations is limited because it can only capture explicit correlations between events with discourse markers, and cannot capture many implicit correlations. To this end, we propose a novel generative approach for this task, in which a pretrained language model is fine-tuned with an event-centric pretraining objective and predicts the next event within a generative paradigm. Specifically, we first introduce a novel event-level blank infilling strategy as the learning objective to inject event-level knowledge into the pretrained language model, and then design a likelihood-based contrastive loss for fine-tuning the generative model. Instead of using an additional prediction layer, we perform prediction by using sequence likelihoods generated by the generative model. Our approach models correlations between events in a soft way without any external knowledge. The likelihood-based prediction eliminates the need to use additional networks to make predictions and is somewhat interpretable since it scores each word in the event. Experimental results on the multi-choice narrative cloze~(MCNC) task demonstrate that our approach achieves better results than other state-of-the-art baselines.

"WIDER & CLOSER: Mixture of Short-channel Distillers for Zero-shot Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition","Jun-Yu Ma, Beiduo Chen, Jia-Chen Gu, Zhen-Hua Ling, Wu Guo, Quan Liu, Zhigang Chen and Cong Liu",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03506","Zero-shot cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER) aims at transferring knowledge from annotated and rich-resource data in source languages to unlabeled and lean-resource data in target languages. Existing mainstream methods based on the teacher-student distillation framework ignore the rich and complementary information lying in the intermediate layers of pre-trained language models, and domain-invariant information is easily lost during transfer. In this study, a mixture of short-channel distillers (MSD) method is proposed to fully interact the rich hierarchical information in the teacher model and to transfer knowledge to the student model sufficiently and efficiently. Concretely, a multi-channel distillation framework is designed for sufficient information transfer by aggregating multiple distillers as a mixture. Besides, an unsupervised method adopting parallel domain adaptation is proposed to shorten the channels between the teacher and student models to preserve domain-invariant features. Experiments on four datasets across nine languages demonstrate that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot cross-lingual NER and shows great generalization and compatibility across languages and fields.","No"
"Text Embeddings by Weakly-Supervised Contrastive Pre-training","Liang Wang, Nan Yang, Xiaolong Huang, Binxing Jiao, Linjun Yang, Daxin Jiang, Rangan Majumder, Furu Wei",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03533","This paper presents E5, a family of state-of-the-art text embeddings that transfer well to a wide range of tasks. The model is trained in a contrastive manner with weak supervision signals from our curated large-scale text pair dataset (called CCPairs). E5 can be readily used as a general-purpose embedding model for any tasks requiring a single-vector representation of texts such as retrieval, clustering, and classification, achieving strong performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We conduct extensive evaluations on 56 datasets from the BEIR and MTEB benchmarks. For zero-shot settings, E5 is the first model that outperforms the strong BM25 baseline on the BEIR retrieval benchmark without using any labeled data. When fine-tuned, E5 obtains the best results on the MTEB benchmark, beating existing embedding models with 40x more parameters.","No"
"Talking About Large Language Models","Murray Shanahan",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03551","Thanks to rapid progress in artificial intelligence, we have entered an era when technology and philosophy intersect in interesting ways. Sitting squarely at the centre of this intersection are large language models (LLMs). The more adept LLMs become at mimicking human language, the more vulnerable we become to anthropomorphism, to seeing the systems in which they are embedded as more human-like than they really are. This trend is amplified by the natural tendency to use philosophically loaded terms, such as 'knows', 'believes', and 'thinks', when describing these systems. To mitigate this trend, this paper advocates the practice of repeatedly stepping back to remind ourselves of how LLMs, and the systems of which they form a part, actually work. The hope is that increased scientific precision will encourage more philosophical nuance in the discourse around artificial intelligence, both within the field and in the public sphere.","No"
"Low-Resource End-to-end Sanskrit TTS using Tacotron2, WaveGlow and Transfer Learning","Ankur Debnath, Shridevi S Patil, Gangotri Nadiger, Ramakrishnan Angarai Ganesan",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03558","End-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) systems have been developed for European languages like English and Spanish with state-of-the-art speech quality, prosody, and naturalness. However, development of end-to-end TTS for Indian languages is lagging behind in terms of quality. The challenges involved in such a task are: 1) scarcity of quality training data; 2) low efficiency during training and inference; 3) slow convergence in the case of large vocabulary size. In our work reported in this paper, we have investigated the use of fine-tuning the English-pretrained Tacotron2 model with limited Sanskrit data to synthesize natural sounding speech in Sanskrit in low resource settings. Our experiments show encouraging results, achieving an overall MOS of 3.38 from 37 evaluators with good Sanskrit spoken knowledge. This is really a very good result, considering the fact that the speech data we have used is of duration 2.5 hours only.","No"

"G-MAP: General Memory-Augmented Pre-trained Language Model for Domain Tasks","Zhongwei Wan, Yichun Yin, Wei Zhang, Jiaxin Shi, Lifeng Shang, Guangyong Chen, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03613","Recently, domain-specific PLMs have been proposed to boost the task performance of specific domains (e.g., biomedical and computer science) by continuing to pre-train general PLMs with domain-specific corpora. However, this Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT; Gururangan et al. (2020)) tends to forget the previous general knowledge acquired by general PLMs, which leads to a catastrophic forgetting phenomenon and sub-optimal performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new framework of General Memory Augmented Pre-trained Language Model (G-MAP), which augments the domain-specific PLM by a memory representation built from the frozen general PLM without losing any general knowledge. Specifically, we propose a new memory-augmented layer, and based on it, different augmented strategies are explored to build the memory representation and then adaptively fuse it into the domain-specific PLM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of G-MAP on various domains (biomedical and computer science publications, news, and reviews) and different kinds (text classification, QA, NER) of tasks, and the extensive results show that the proposed G-MAP can achieve SOTA results on all tasks.","No"
"M3ST: Mix at Three Levels for Speech Translation","Xuxin Cheng, Qianqian Dong, Fengpeng Yue, Tom Ko, Mingxuan Wang, Yuexian Zou",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03657","How to solve the data scarcity problem for end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST)? It's well known that data augmentation is an efficient method to improve performance for many tasks by enlarging the dataset. In this paper, we propose Mix at three levels for Speech Translation (M^3ST) method to increase the diversity of the augmented training corpus. Specifically, we conduct two phases of fine-tuning based on a pre-trained model using external machine translation (MT) data. In the first stage of fine-tuning, we mix the training corpus at three levels, including word level, sentence level and frame level, and fine-tune the entire model with mixed data. At the second stage of fine-tuning, we take both original speech sequences and original text sequences in parallel into the model to fine-tune the network, and use Jensen-Shannon divergence to regularize their outputs. Experiments on MuST-C speech translation benchmark and analysis show that M^3ST outperforms current strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results on eight directions with an average BLEU of 29.9.","No"

We evaluate our approach on three labelled datasets and show that our adaptation framework outperforms the corresponding non-adaptive models for various combinations of transformer models, source datasets and target corpora.","No"

However, existing conversational AI techniques still suffer from various limitations. One such limitation is a lack of well-developed methods for incorporating auxiliary information that could help a model understand conversational context better. In this paper, we explore how persona-based information could help improve the quality of response generation in conversations. First, we provide a literature review focusing on the current state-of-the-art methods that utilize persona information. We evaluate two strong baseline methods, the Ranking Profile Memory Network and the Poly-Encoder, on the NeurIPS ConvAI2 benchmark dataset. Our analysis elucidates the importance of incorporating persona information into conversational systems. Additionally, our study highlights several limitations with current state-of-the-art methods and outlines challenges and future research directions for advancing personalized conversational AI technology.","No"
"Intent Recognition in Conversational Recommender Systems","Sahar Moradizeyveh",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03721","Any organization needs to improve their products, services, and processes. In this context, engaging with customers and understanding their journey is essential. Organizations have leveraged various techniques and technologies to support customer engagement, from call centres to chatbots and virtual agents. Recently, these systems have used Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze large volumes of customer feedback and engagement data. The goal is to understand customers in context and provide meaningful answers across various channels. Despite multiple advances in Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Recommender Systems (RS), it is still challenging to understand the intent behind customer questions during the customer journey. To address this challenge, in this paper, we study and analyze the recent work in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) in general and, more specifically, in chatbot-based CRS. We introduce a pipeline to contextualize the input utterances in conversations. We then take the next step towards leveraging reverse feature engineering to link the contextualized input and learning model to support intent recognition. Since performance evaluation is achieved based on different ML models, we use transformer base models to evaluate the proposed approach using a labelled dialogue dataset (MSDialogue) of question-answering interactions between information seekers and answer providers.","No"

"A Study on Extracting Named Entities from Fine-tuned vs. Differentially Private Fine-tuned BERT Models","Andor Diera and Nicolas Lell and Aygul Garifullina and Ansgar Scherp",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03749","Privacy preserving deep learning is an emerging field in machine learning that aims to mitigate the privacy risks in the use of deep neural networks. One such risk is training data extraction from language models that have been trained on datasets , which contain personal and privacy sensitive information. In our study, we investigate the extent of named entity memorization in fine-tuned BERT models. We use single-label text classification as representative downstream task and employ three different fine-tuning setups in our experiments, including one with Differentially Privacy (DP). We create a large number of text samples from the fine-tuned BERT models utilizing a custom sequential sampling strategy with two prompting strategies. We search in these samples for named entities and check if they are also present in the fine-tuning datasets. We experiment with two benchmark datasets in the domains of emails and blogs. We show that the application of DP has a huge effect on the text generation capabilities of BERT. Furthermore, we show that a fine-tuned BERT does not generate more named entities entities specific to the fine-tuning dataset than a BERT model that is pre-trained only. This suggests that BERT is unlikely to emit personal or privacy sensitive named entities. Overall, our results are important to understand to what extent BERT-based services are prone to training data extraction attacks.","No"
"An Overview of Indian Spoken Language Recognition from Machine Learning Perspective","Spandan Dey, Md Sahidullah, Goutam Saha",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03812","Automatic spoken language identification (LID) is a very important research field in the era of multilingual voice-command-based human-computer interaction (HCI). A front-end LID module helps to improve the performance of many speech-based applications in the multilingual scenario. India is a populous country with diverse cultures and languages. The majority of the Indian population needs to use their respective native languages for verbal interaction with machines. Therefore, the development of efficient Indian spoken language recognition systems is useful for adapting smart technologies in every section of Indian society. The field of Indian LID has started gaining momentum in the last two decades, mainly due to the development of several standard multilingual speech corpora for the Indian languages. Even though significant research progress has already been made in this field, to the best of our knowledge, there are not many attempts to analytically review them collectively. In this work, we have conducted one of the very first attempts to present a comprehensive review of the Indian spoken language recognition research field. In-depth analysis has been presented to emphasize the unique challenges of low-resource and mutual influences for developing LID systems in the Indian contexts. Several essential aspects of the Indian LID research, such as the detailed description of the available speech corpora, the major research contributions, including the earlier attempts based on statistical modeling to the recent approaches based on different neural network architectures, and the future research trends are discussed. This review work will help assess the state of the present Indian LID research by any active researcher or any research enthusiasts from related fields.","No"
"Robustness of Learning from Task Instructions","Jiasheng Gu, Hanzi Xu, Liangyu Nie and Wenpeng Yin",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03813","Traditional supervised learning mostly works on individual tasks and requires training on a large set of task-specific examples. This paradigm seriously hinders the development of task generalization since preparing a task-specific example set is costly. To build a system that can quickly and easily generalize to new tasks, task instructions have been adopted as an emerging trend of supervision recently. These instructions give the model the definition of the task and allow the model to output the appropriate answer based on the instructions and inputs. However, task instructions are often expressed in different forms, which can be interpreted from two threads: first, some instructions are short sentences and are pretrained language model (PLM) oriented, such as prompts, while other instructions are paragraphs and are human-oriented, such as those in Amazon MTurk; second, different end-users very likely explain the same task with instructions of different textual expressions. A robust system for task generalization should be able to handle any new tasks regardless of the variability of instructions. However, the system robustness in dealing with instruction-driven task generalization is still unexplored. This work investigates the system robustness when the instructions of new tasks are (i) maliciously manipulated, (ii) paraphrased, or (iii) from different levels of conciseness. To our knowledge, this is the first work that systematically studies how robust a PLM is when it is supervised by instructions with different factors of variability.","No"
"A Transformer-Based User Satisfaction Prediction for Proactive Interaction Mechanism in DuerOS","Wei Shen, Xiaonan He, Chuheng Zhang, Xuyun Zhang, Jian XIe",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03817","Recently, spoken dialogue systems have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, serving a huge number of end-users. A common issue is that the errors resulting from noisy utterances, semantic misunderstandings, or lack of knowledge make it hard for a real system to respond properly, possibly leading to an unsatisfactory user experience. To avoid such a case, we consider a proactive interaction mechanism where the system predicts the user satisfaction with the candidate response before giving it to the user. If the user is not likely to be satisfied according to the prediction, the system will ask the user a suitable question to determine the real intent of the user instead of providing the response directly. With such an interaction with the user, the system can give a better response to the user. Previous models that predict the user satisfaction are not applicable to DuerOS which is a large-scale commercial dialogue system. They are based on hand-crafted features and thus can hardly learn the complex patterns lying behind millions of conversations and temporal dependency in multiple turns of the conversation. Moreover, they are trained and evaluated on the benchmark datasets with adequate labels, which are expensive to obtain in a commercial dialogue system. To face these challenges, we propose a pipeline to predict the user satisfaction to help DuerOS decide whether to ask for clarification in each turn. Specifically, we propose to first generate a large number of weak labels and then train a transformer-based model to predict the user satisfaction with these weak labels. Empirically, we deploy and evaluate our model on DuerOS, and observe a 19% relative improvement on the accuracy of user satisfaction prediction and 2.3% relative improvement on user experience.","No"
"Discovering Latent Knowledge in Language Models Without Supervision","Collin Burns, Haotian Ye, Dan Klein, Jacob Steinhardt",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827","Existing techniques for training language models can be misaligned with the truth: if we train models with imitation learning, they may reproduce errors that humans make; if we train them to generate text that humans rate highly, they may output errors that human evaluators can't detect. We propose circumventing this issue by directly finding latent knowledge inside the internal activations of a language model in a purely unsupervised way. Specifically, we introduce a method for accurately answering yes-no questions given only unlabeled model activations. It works by finding a direction in activation space that satisfies logical consistency properties, such as that a statement and its negation have opposite truth values. We show that despite using no supervision and no model outputs, our method can recover diverse knowledge represented in large language models: across 6 models and 10 question-answering datasets, it outperforms zero-shot accuracy by 4\% on average. We also find that it cuts prompt sensitivity in half and continues to maintain high accuracy even when models are prompted to generate incorrect answers. Our results provide an initial step toward discovering what language models know, distinct from what they say, even when we don't have access to explicit ground truth labels.","No"

But, while early effort on rule-based systems found limited success, the emergence of deep learning enabled great advance on this topic. In this thesis, we focus on methods that address the numerous issues that have been imposing the gap between artificial conversational agents and human-level interlocutors. These methods were proposed and experimented with in ways that were inspired by general state-of-the-art AI methodologies.

We first examine the existence of the entrainment phenomenon in human-to-human dialogues in respect to acoustic feature and then extend the analysis to emotion features. The analysis results show strong evidence of entrainment in terms of both acoustic and emotion features. Based on this findings, we implement two entrainment policies and assess if the integration of entrainment principle into a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system improves the synthesis performance and the user experience. It is found that the integration of the entrainment principle into a TTS system brings performance improvement when considering acoustic features, while no obvious improvement is observed when considering emotion features.","No"

"Improve Bilingual TTS Using Dynamic Language and Phonology Embedding","Fengyu Yang, Jian Luan, Yujun Wang",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03435","In most cases, bilingual TTS needs to handle three types of input scripts: first language only, second language only, and second language embedded in the first language. In the latter two situations, the pronunciation and intonation of the second language are usually quite different due to the influence of the first language. Therefore, it is a big challenge to accurately model the pronunciation and intonation of the second language in different contexts without mutual interference. This paper builds a Mandarin-English TTS system to acquire more standard spoken English speech from a monolingual Chinese speaker. We introduce phonology embedding to capture the English differences between different phonology. Embedding mask is applied to language embedding for distinguishing information between different languages and to phonology embedding for focusing on English expression. We specially design an embedding strength modulator to capture the dynamic strength of language and phonology. Experiments show that our approach can produce significantly more natural and standard spoken English speech of the monolingual Chinese speaker. From analysis, we find that suitable phonology control contributes to better performance in different scenarios.","No"

However, similar to the supervised learning, multilingual pre-training may also suffer from language interference and further affect the application of multilingual system. In this paper, we introduce several techniques for improving self-supervised multilingual pre-training by leveraging auxiliary language information, including the language adversarial training, language embedding and language adaptive training during the pre-training stage. We conduct experiments on a multilingual ASR task consisting of 16 languages. Our experimental results demonstrate 14.3% relative gain over the standard XLSR model, and 19.8% relative gain over the no pre-training multilingual model.","No"

While its versatile usability has been widely investigated in many domains, its applications to recommender systems still remain underexplored. We show that language modeling applied directly to task-specific user histories achieves excellent results on diverse recommendation tasks. Also, leveraging additional task-agnostic user histories delivers significant performance benefits.

For the fine-tuning phase, we use both Direct Assessment (DA) and Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) data from past years' WMT competitions. Finally, we collect the source-only evaluation results, and ensemble the predictions generated by two UniTE models, whose backbones are XLM-R and InfoXLM, respectively. Results show that our models reach 1st overall ranking in the Multilingual and English-Russian settings, and 2nd overall ranking in English-German and Chinese-English settings, showing relatively strong performances in this year's quality estimation competition.","No"

Existing approaches for this task have yielded impressive results when the training and testing data are from the same domain. However, these methods show a drastic decrease in performance when applied to cross-domain settings where the domain of the testing data differs from that of the training data. To address this lack of extensibility and robustness, we propose a novel approach for automatically constructing domain-specific knowledge graphs that contain information relevant to the identification of aspect terms. We introduce a methodology for injecting information from these knowledge graphs into Transformer models, including two alternative mechanisms for knowledge insertion: via query enrichment and via manipulation of attention patterns. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for cross-domain aspect term extraction using our approach and investigate how the amount of external knowledge available to the Transformer impacts model performance.","No"
"Entity-Focused Dense Passage Retrieval for Outside-Knowledge Visual Question Answering","Jialin Wu and Raymond J. Mooney",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10176","Most Outside-Knowledge Visual Question Answering (OK-VQA) systems employ a two-stage framework that first retrieves external knowledge given the visual question and then predicts the answer based on the retrieved content. However, the retrieved knowledge is often inadequate. Retrievals are frequently too general and fail to cover specific knowledge needed to answer the question. Also, the naturally available supervision (whether the passage contains the correct answer) is weak and does not guarantee question relevancy. To address these issues, we propose an Entity-Focused Retrieval (EnFoRe) model that provides stronger supervision during training and recognizes question-relevant entities to help retrieve more specific knowledge. Experiments show that our EnFoRe model achieves superior retrieval performance on OK-VQA, the currently largest outside-knowledge VQA dataset. We also combine the retrieved knowledge with state-of-the-art VQA models, and achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on OK-VQA.","No"

Many approaches attempt to address this scenario, most of which rely on complex structures or have high computation complexity. The representation learning of the heterogeneous star graph containing text nodes and type nodes is investigated in this paper. In addition, we revise the graph attention mechanism into a hybrid form to address its unreasonableness in specific topologies.

We reveal settings where existing continued pretraining methods lack promptability. We also identify current methodological gaps, which we fill with thorough large-scale experiments. We demonstrate that a simple recipe, continued pretraining that incorporates a trainable prompt during multi-task learning, leads to improved promptability in both zero- and few-shot settings compared to existing methods, up to 31% relative. On the other hand, we find that continued pretraining using MAML-style meta-learning, a method that directly optimizes few-shot promptability, yields subpar performance.

However, the manual creation of query vectors, which fail to adapt to the rich semantic information in the context, limits these approaches. An end-to-end entity detection approach with proposer and regressor is presented in this paper to tackle the issues. First, the proposer utilizes the feature pyramid network to generate high-quality entity proposals. Then, the regressor refines the proposals for generating the final prediction. The model adopts encoder-only architecture and thus obtains the advantages of the richness of query semantics, high precision of entity localization, and easiness for model training.

However, a theoretical framework for studying their relationships is still missing. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating the linear dependency between pre-trained LMs. The linear dependency of LMs is defined analogously to the linear dependency of vectors. We propose Language Model Decomposition (LMD) to represent a LM using a linear combination of other LMs as basis, and derive the closed-form solution. A goodness-of-fit metric for LMD similar to the coefficient of determination is defined and used to measure the linear dependency of a set of LMs. In experiments, we find that BERT and eleven (11) BERT-like LMs are 91% linearly dependent. This observation suggests that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) LMs are highly 'correlated'. To further advance SOTA we need more diverse and novel LMs that are less dependent on existing LMs.","No"
"Improving Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction via Template-Order Data Augmentation","Mengting Hu, Yike Wu, Hang Gao, Yinhao Bai, Shiwan Zhao",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10291","Recently, aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) has become a popular task in the field of aspect-level sentiment analysis. Previous work utilizes a predefined template to paraphrase the original sentence into a structure target sequence, which can be easily decoded as quadruplets of the form (aspect category, aspect term, opinion term, sentiment polarity). The template involves the four elements in a fixed order. However, we observe that this solution contradicts with the order-free property of the ASQP task, since there is no need to fix the template order as long as the quadruplet is extracted correctly. Inspired by the observation, we study the effects of template orders and find that some orders help the generative model achieve better performance. It is hypothesized that different orders provide various views of the quadruplet. Therefore, we propose a simple but effective method to identify the most proper orders, and further combine multiple proper templates as data augmentation to improve the ASQP task. Specifically, we use the pre-trained language model to select the orders with minimal entropy. By fine-tuning the pre-trained language model with these template orders, our approach improves the performance of quad prediction, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly in low-resource settings.","No"

Empirical studies have shown that the current objective sampling in an ad-hoc manual setting makes the learned language representation barely converge to the desired optimum. Thus, we propose \textit{MOMETAS}, a novel adaptive sampler based on meta-learning, which learns the latent sampling pattern on arbitrary pre-training objectives. Such a design is lightweight with negligible additional training overhead. To validate our approach, we adopt five objectives and conduct continual pre-training with BERT-base and BERT-large models, where MOMETAS demonstrates universal performance gain over other rule-based sampling strategies on 14 natural language processing tasks.","No"

However, previous methods require excessive memory, computations, and time which are serious bottlenecks in their real-world application. To address such limitations, we propose an effective yet efficient method for language detoxification using an attribute-discriminative latent space. Specifically, we project the latent space of an original Transformer LM to a discriminative latent space on which the texts are well-separated by their attributes, with the help of a projection block and a discriminator. This allows the LM to control the text generation to be non-toxic with minimal memory and computation overhead.

"The Devil in Linear Transformer","Zhen Qin, XiaoDong Han, Weixuan Sun, Dongxu Li, Lingpeng Kong, Nick Barnes and Yiran Zhong",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10340","Linear transformers aim to reduce the quadratic space-time complexity of vanilla transformers. However, they usually suffer from degraded performances on various tasks and corpus. In this paper, we examine existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify two key issues that lead to such performance gaps: 1) unbounded gradients in the attention computation adversely impact the convergence of linear transformer models; 2) attention dilution which trivially distributes attention scores over long sequences while neglecting neighbouring structures. To address these issues, we first identify that the scaling of attention matrices is the devil in unbounded gradients, which turns out unnecessary in linear attention as we show theoretically and empirically. To this end, we propose a new linear attention that replaces the scaling operation with a normalization to stabilize gradients. For the issue of attention dilution, we leverage a diagonal attention to confine attention to only neighbouring tokens in early layers. Benefiting from the stable gradients and improved attention, our new linear transformer model, transNormer, demonstrates superior performance on text classification and language modeling tasks, as well as on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark, surpassing vanilla transformer and existing linear variants by a clear margin while being significantly more space-time efficient.

To preserve the advantage and eliminate the disadvantage of different granularity evidence, we propose MuGER$^2$, a Multi-Granularity Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning approach. In evidence retrieval, a unified retriever is designed to learn the multi-granularity evidence from the heterogeneous data.

"Hybrid-Regressive Neural Machine Translation","Qiang Wang, Xinhui Hu, Ming Chen",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10416","In this work, we empirically confirm that non-autoregressive translation with an iterative refinement mechanism (IR-NAT) suffers from poor acceleration robustness because it is more sensitive to decoding batch size and computing device setting than autoregressive translation (AT). Inspired by it, we attempt to investigate how to combine the strengths of autoregressive and non-autoregressive translation paradigms better. To this end, we demonstrate through synthetic experiments that prompting a small number of AT's predictions can promote one-shot non-autoregressive translation to achieve the equivalent performance of IR-NAT. Following this line, we propose a new two-stage translation prototype called hybrid-regressive translation (HRT). Specifically, HRT first generates discontinuous sequences via autoregression (e.g., make a prediction every k tokens, k>1) and then fills in all previously skipped tokens at once in a non-autoregressive manner. We also propose a bag of techniques to effectively and efficiently train HRT without adding any model parameters. HRT achieves the state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.49 on the WMT En-De task and is at least 1.5x faster than AT, regardless of batch size and device. In addition, another bonus of HRT is that it successfully inherits the good characteristics of AT in the deep-encoder-shallow-decoder architecture. Concretely, compared to the vanilla HRT with a 6-layer encoder and 6-layer decoder, the inference speed of HRT with a 12-layer encoder and 1-layer decoder is further doubled on both GPU and CPU without BLEU loss.","No"

Extensive experiments and detailed analyses not only demonstrate that the training data constructed by our method effectively improves the performance of CGEC models, but also reflect that our benchmark is an excellent resource for further development of the CGEC field.","No"

"Attribution and Obfuscation of Neural Text Authorship: A Data Mining Perspective","Adaku Uchendu and Thai Le and Dongwon Lee",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10488","Two interlocking research questions of growing interest and importance in privacy research are Authorship Attribution (AA) and Authorship Obfuscation (AO). Given an artifact, especially a text t in question, an AA solution aims to accurately attribute t to its true author out of many candidate authors while an AO solution aims to modify t to hide its true authorship. Traditionally, the notion of authorship and its accompanying privacy concern is only toward human authors. However, in recent years, due to the explosive advancements in Neural Text Generation (NTG) techniques in NLP, capable of synthesizing human-quality open-ended texts (so-called 'neural texts'), one has to now consider authorships by humans, machines, or their combination. Due to the implications and potential threats of neural texts when used maliciously, it has become critical to understand the limitations of traditional AA/AO solutions and develop novel AA/AO solutions in dealing with neural texts. In this survey, therefore, we make a comprehensive review of recent literature on the attribution and obfuscation of neural text authorship from a Data Mining perspective, and share our view on their limitations and promising research directions.","No"
"Towards a neural architecture of language: Deep learning versus logistics of access in neural architectures for compositional processing","Frank van der Velde",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10543","Recently, a number of articles have argued that deep learning models such as GPT could also capture key aspects of language processing in the human mind and brain. However, I will argue that these models are not suitable as neural models of human language. Firstly, because they fail on fundamental boundary conditions, such as the amount of learning they require. This would in fact imply that the mechanisms of GPT and brain language processing are fundamentally different. Secondly, because they do not possess the logistics of access needed for compositional and productive human language processing. Neural architectures could possess logistics of access based on small-world like network structures, in which processing does not consist of symbol manipulation but of controlling the flow of activation. In this view, two complementary approaches would be needed to investigate the relation between brain and cognition. Investigating learning methods could reveal how 'learned cognition' as found in deep learning could develop in the brain. However, neural architectures with logistics of access should also be developed to account for 'productive cognition' as required for natural or artificial human language processing. Later on, these approaches could perhaps be combined to see how such architectures could develop by learning and development from a simpler basis.","No"
"Language Does More Than Describe: On The Lack Of Figurative Speech in Text-To-Image Models","Ricardo Kleinlein, Cristina Luna-Jim\'enez, Fernando Fern\'andez-Mart\'inez",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10578","The impressive capacity shown by recent text-to-image diffusion models to generate high-quality pictures from textual input prompts has leveraged the debate about the very definition of art. Nonetheless, these models have been trained using text data collected from content-based labelling protocols that focus on describing the items and actions in an image but neglect any subjective appraisal. Consequently, these automatic systems need rigorous descriptions of the elements and the pictorial style of the image to be generated, otherwise failing to deliver. As potential indicators of the actual artistic capabilities of current generative models, we characterise the sentimentality, objectiveness and degree of abstraction of publicly available text data used to train current text-to-image diffusion models. Considering the sharp difference observed between their language style and that typically employed in artistic contexts, we suggest generative models should incorporate additional sources of subjective information in their training in order to overcome (or at least to alleviate) some of their current limitations, thus effectively unleashing a truly artistic and creative generation.","No"

Such prior works mostly employ end-to-end neural generation models to predict event sequences for a story. However, such generation models struggle to guarantee the narrative coherence of separate events due to the hallucination problem, and additionally the generated event sequences are often hard to control due to the end-to-end nature of the models. To address these challenges, we propose NGEP, an novel event planning framework which generates an event sequence by performing inference on an automatically constructed event graph and enhances generalisation ability through a neural event advisor. We conduct a range of experiments on multiple criteria, and the results demonstrate that our graph-based neural framework outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) event planning approaches, considering both the performance of event sequence generation and the effectiveness on the downstream task of story generation.","No"

We show that in stark contrast to the way human process language, DALLE-2 does not follow the constraint that each word has a single role in the interpretation, and sometimes re-use the same symbol for different purposes. We collect a set of stimuli that reflect the phenomenon: we show that DALLE-2 depicts both senses of nouns with multiple senses at once; and that a given word can modify the properties of two distinct entities in the image, or can be depicted as one object and also modify the properties of another object, creating a semantic leakage of properties between entities. Taken together, our study highlights the differences between DALLE-2 and human language processing and opens an avenue for future study on the inductive biases of text-to-image models.","No"

In spite of the success of prior works with the application of pre-trained models, current neural models for Chinese stories still struggle to generate high-quality long text narratives. We hypothesise that this stems from ambiguity in syntactically parsing the Chinese language, which does not have explicit delimiters for word segmentation. Consequently, neural models suffer from the inefficient capturing of features in Chinese narratives. In this paper, we present a new generation framework that enhances the feature capturing mechanism by informing the generation model of dependencies between words and additionally augmenting the semantic representation learning through synonym denoising training. We conduct a range of experiments, and the results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art Chinese generation models on all evaluation metrics, demonstrating the benefits of enhanced dependency and semantic representation learning.","No"

We create a benchmark with 8 relation extraction (RE) datasets covering different languages, domains and contexts and perform extensive comparisons over the proposed schemes with combinations. Our experiments illustrate: (i) Though prompt-based tuning is beneficial in low-resource RE, there is still much potential for improvement, especially in extracting relations from cross-sentence contexts with multiple relational triples; (ii) Balancing methods are not always helpful for RE with long-tailed distribution; (iii) Data augmentation complements existing baselines and can bring much performance gain, while self-training may not consistently achieve advancement to low-resource RE.

We discuss the deficiencies in previous work and propose our suggestions that the research on the Security-oriented adversarial NLP (SoadNLP) should: (1) evaluate their methods on security tasks to demonstrate the real-world concerns; (2) consider real-world attackers' goals, instead of developing impractical methods. To this end, we first collect, process, and release a security datasets collection Advbench. Then, we reformalize the task and adjust the emphasis on different goals in SoadNLP. Next, we propose a simple method based on heuristic rules that can easily fulfill the actual adversarial goals to simulate real-world attack methods.

Here, besides identity terms, we take into account high-level latent features learned by the classifier and investigate the interaction between these features and identity terms. For a multi-class toxic language classifier, we leverage a concept-based explanation framework to calculate the sensitivity of the model to the concept of sentiment, which has been used before as a salient feature for toxic language detection. Our results show that although for some classes, the classifier has learned the sentiment information as expected, this information is outweighed by the influence of identity terms as input features. This work is a step towards evaluating procedural fairness, where unfair processes lead to unfair outcomes. The produced knowledge can guide debiasing techniques to ensure that important concepts besides identity terms are well-represented in training datasets.","No"

With the development of pre-trained language models, many prompt-based approaches to data-efficient information extraction have been proposed and achieved impressive performance. However, existing prompt learning methods for information extraction are still susceptible to several potential limitations: (i) semantic gap between natural language and output structure knowledge with pre-defined schema; (ii) representation learning with locally individual instances limits the performance given the insufficient features. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of schema-aware Reference As Prompt (RAP), which dynamically leverage schema and knowledge inherited from global (few-shot) training data for each sample. Specifically, we propose a schema-aware reference store, which unifies symbolic schema and relevant textual instances. Then, we employ a dynamic reference integration module to retrieve pertinent knowledge from the datastore as prompts during training and inference.

"Exclusive Supermask Subnetwork Training for Continual Learning","Prateek Yadav, Mohit Bansal",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10209","Continual Learning (CL) methods mainly focus on avoiding catastrophic forgetting and learning representations that are transferable to new tasks. Recently, Wortsman et al. (2020) proposed a CL method, SupSup, which uses a randomly initialized, fixed base network (model) and finds a supermask for each new task that selectively keeps or removes each weight to produce a subnetwork. They prevent forgetting as the network weights are not being updated. Although there is no forgetting, the performance of the supermask is sub-optimal because fixed weights restrict its representational power. Furthermore, there is no accumulation or transfer of knowledge inside the model when new tasks are learned. Hence, we propose ExSSNeT (Exclusive Supermask SubNEtwork Training), which performs exclusive and non-overlapping subnetwork weight training. This avoids conflicting updates to the shared weights by subsequent tasks to improve performance while still preventing forgetting. Furthermore, we propose a novel KNN-based Knowledge Transfer (KKT) module that dynamically initializes a new task's mask based on previous tasks for improving knowledge transfer. We demonstrate that ExSSNeT outperforms SupSup and other strong previous methods on both text classification and vision tasks while preventing forgetting. Moreover, ExSSNeT is particularly advantageous for sparse masks that activate 2-10% of the model parameters, resulting in an average improvement of 8.3% over SupSup. Additionally, ExSSNeT scales to a large number of tasks (100), and our KKT module helps to learn new tasks faster while improving overall performance.

These high acoustic variations along with the scarcity of child speech corpora have impeded the development of a reliable speech recognition system for children. In this paper, a speaker- and age-invariant training approach based on adversarial multi-task learning is proposed. The system consists of one generator shared network that learns to generate speaker- and age-invariant features connected to three discrimination networks, for phoneme, age, and speaker. The generator network is trained to minimize the phoneme-discrimination loss and maximize the speaker- and age-discrimination losses in an adversarial multi-task learning fashion. The generator network is a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) architecture while the three discriminators are feed-forward networks. The system was applied to the OGI speech corpora and achieved a 13% reduction in the WER of the ASR.","No"

A recent trend is to use Transformer or its variants in music generation, which is, however, suboptimal, because the full attention cannot efficiently model the typically long music sequences (e.g., over 10,000 tokens), and the existing models have shortcomings in generating musical repetition structures. In this paper, we propose Museformer, a Transformer with a novel fine- and coarse-grained attention for music generation. Specifically, with the fine-grained attention, a token of a specific bar directly attends to all the tokens of the bars that are most relevant to music structures (e.g., the previous 1st, 2nd, 4th and 8th bars, selected via similarity statistics); with the coarse-grained attention, a token only attends to the summarization of the other bars rather than each token of them so as to reduce the computational cost. The advantages are two-fold. First, it can capture both music structure-related correlations via the fine-grained attention, and other contextual information via the coarse-grained attention. Second, it is efficient and can model over 3X longer music sequences compared to its full-attention counterpart. Both objective and subjective experimental results demonstrate its ability to generate long music sequences with high quality and better structures.","No"

"Enhanced vectors for top-k document retrieval in Question Answering","Mohammed Hammad",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10584","Modern day applications, especially information retrieval webapps that involve 'search' as their use cases are gradually moving towards 'answering' modules. Conversational chatbots which have been proved to be more engaging to users, use Question Answering as their core. Since, precise answering is computationally expensive, several approaches have been developed to prefetch the most relevant documents/passages from the database that contain the answer. We propose a different approach that retrieves the evidence documents efficiently and accurately, making sure that the relevant document for a given user query is not missed. We do so by assigning each document (or passage in our case), a unique identifier and using them to create dense vectors which can be efficiently indexed. More precisely, we use the identifier to predict randomly sampled context window words of the relevant question corresponding to the passage along with the words of passage itself. This naturally embeds the passage identifier into the vector space in such a way that the embedding is closer to the question without compromising he information content. This approach enables efficient creation of real-time query vectors in ~4 milliseconds.","No"
"RankT5: Fine-Tuning T5 for Text Ranking with Ranking Losses","Honglei Zhuang, Zhen Qin, Rolf Jagerman, Kai Hui, Ji Ma, Jing Lu, Jianmo Ni, Xuanhui Wang and Michael Bendersky",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10634","Recently, substantial progress has been made in text ranking based on pretrained language models such as BERT. However, there are limited studies on how to leverage more powerful sequence-to-sequence models such as T5. Existing attempts usually formulate text ranking as classification and rely on postprocessing to obtain a ranked list. In this paper, we propose RankT5 and study two T5-based ranking model structures, an encoder-decoder and an encoder-only one, so that they not only can directly output ranking scores for each query-document pair, but also can be fine-tuned with 'pairwise' or 'listwise' ranking losses to optimize ranking performances. Our experiments show that the proposed models with ranking losses can achieve substantial ranking performance gains on different public text ranking data sets. Moreover, when fine-tuned with listwise ranking losses, the ranking model appears to have better zero-shot ranking performance on out-of-domain data sets compared to the model fine-tuned with classification losses.","No"

This pipeline covers scenarios like question answering or navigational queries, however, for information-seeking scenarios, users often provide information on whether a document is relevant to their query in form of clicks or explicit feedback. Therefore, in this work, we explore how relevance feedback can be directly integrated into neural re-ranking models by adopting few-shot and parameter-efficient learning techniques. Specifically, we introduce a kNN approach that re-ranks documents based on their similarity with the query and the documents the user considers relevant. Further, we explore Cross-Encoder models that we pre-train using meta-learning and subsequently fine-tune for each query, training only on the feedback documents. To evaluate our different integration strategies, we transform four existing information retrieval datasets into the relevance feedback scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating relevance feedback directly in neural re-ranking models improves their performance, and fusing lexical ranking with our best performing neural re-ranker outperforms all other methods by 5.2 nDCG@20.","No"
"Transformers generalize differently from information stored in context vs in weights","Stephanie C.Y. Chan, Ishita Dasgupta, Junkyung Kim, Dharshan Kumaran, Andrew K. Lampinen, Felix Hill",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05675","Transformer models can use two fundamentally different kinds of information: information stored in weights during training, and information provided ``in-context'' at inference time. In this work, we show that transformers exhibit different inductive biases in how they represent and generalize from the information in these two sources. In particular, we characterize whether they generalize via parsimonious rules (rule-based generalization) or via direct comparison with observed examples (exemplar-based generalization). This is of important practical consequence, as it informs whether to encode information in weights or in context, depending on how we want models to use that information. In transformers trained on controlled stimuli, we find that generalization from weights is more rule-based whereas generalization from context is largely exemplar-based. In contrast, we find that in transformers pre-trained on natural language, in-context learning is significantly rule-based, with larger models showing more rule-basedness. We hypothesise that rule-based generalization from in-context information might be an emergent consequence of large-scale training on language, which has sparse rule-like structure. Using controlled stimuli, we verify that transformers pretrained on data containing sparse rule-like structure exhibit more rule-based generalization.","No"
"Shapley Head Pruning: Identifying and Removing Interference in Multilingual Transformers","William Held and Diyi Yang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05709","Multilingual transformer-based models demonstrate remarkable zero and few-shot transfer across languages by learning and reusing language-agnostic features. However, as a fixed-size model acquires more languages, its performance across all languages degrades, a phenomenon termed interference. Often attributed to limited model capacity, interference is commonly addressed by adding additional parameters despite evidence that transformer-based models are overparameterized. In this work, we show that it is possible to reduce interference by instead identifying and pruning language-specific parameters. First, we use Shapley Values, a credit allocation metric from coalitional game theory, to identify attention heads that introduce interference. Then, we show that removing identified attention heads from a fixed model improves performance for a target language on both sentence classification and structural prediction, seeing gains as large as 24.7\%. Finally, we provide insights on language-agnostic and language-specific attention heads using attention visualization.","No"
"Relational Embeddings for Language Independent Stance Detection","Joseba Fernandez de Landa and Rodrigo Agerri",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05715","The large majority of the research performed on stance detection has been focused on developing more or less sophisticated text classification systems, even when many benchmarks are based on social network data such as Twitter. This paper aims to take on the stance detection task by placing the emphasis not so much on the text itself but on the interaction data available on social networks. More specifically, we propose a new method to leverage social information such as friends and retweets by generating relational embeddings, namely, dense vector representations of interaction pairs. Our method can be applied to any language and target without any manual tuning. Our experiments on seven publicly available datasets and four different languages show that combining our relational embeddings with textual methods helps to substantially improve performance, obtaining best results for six out of seven evaluation settings, outperforming strong baselines based on large pre-trained language models.","No"

That is why the ability to train models with limited annotation budgets is of great importance. In this context, it has been shown that under tight annotation budgets the choice of data representation is key. The goal of this paper is to better understand why this is so. With this goal in mind, we propose a metric that measures the extent to which a given representation is structurally aligned with a task. We conduct experiments on several text classification datasets testing a variety of models and representations. Using our proposed metric we show that an efficient representation for a task (i.e. one that enables learning from few samples) is a representation that induces a good alignment between latent input structure and class structure.","No"

In this paper, we introduce a new automatic evaluation metric to measure the semantic diversity of generated responses. Through human evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed metric captures human judgments on response diversity better than existing lexical-level diversity metrics. Furthermore, motivated by analyzing an existing dialogue dataset, we propose a simple yet effective learning method that improves the semantic diversity of generated responses. Our learning method weights training samples based on the semantic distribution of the training set. We show that our learning method improves response diversity and coherency better than other baseline methods through automatic and human evaluation.","No"

There is no one complete corpus of the Chukchi language, so most of the work consisted in collecting audio and texts in the Chukchi language from open sources and processing them. We managed to collect 21:34:23 hours of audio recordings and 112,719 sentences (or 2,068,273 words) of text in the Chukchi language. The XLSR model was trained on the obtained data, which showed good results even with a small amount of data. Besides the fact that the Chukchi language is a low-resource language, it is also polysynthetic, which significantly complicates any automatic processing. Thus, the usual WER metric for evaluating ASR becomes less indicative for a polysynthetic language. However, the CER metric showed good results. The question of metrics for polysynthetic languages remains open.","No"

Transformer sequence tagging models are effective at capturing long bi-directional context, which is crucial for automatic punctuation. A typical Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) production system, however, is constrained by real-time requirements, making it hard to incorporate the right context when making punctuation decisions. In this paper, we propose a streaming approach for punctuation or re-punctuation of ASR output using dynamic decoding windows and measure its impact on punctuation and segmentation accuracy in a variety of scenarios. The new system tackles over-segmentation issues, improving segmentation F0.5-score by 13.9%. Streaming punctuation achieves an average BLEU-score gain of 0.66 for the downstream task of Machine Translation (MT).","No"

Our proposed deliberation is multilingual, i.e., the text encoder encodes hypothesis text from multiple languages, and the decoder attends to multilingual text and audio. We investigate scaling the deliberation text encoder and decoder, and compare scaling the deliberation decoder and the first-pass cascaded encoder. We show that deliberation improves the average WER on 9 languages by 4% relative compared to the single-pass model. By increasing the size of the deliberation up to 1B parameters, the average WER improvement increases to 9%, with up to 14% for certain languages.

"Social-Group-Agnostic Word Embedding Debiasing via the Stereotype Content Model","Ali Omrani, Brendan Kennedy, Mohammad Atari, Morteza Dehghani",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05831","Existing word embedding debiasing methods require social-group-specific word pairs (e.g., 'man'-'woman') for each social attribute (e.g., gender), which cannot be used to mitigate bias for other social groups, making these methods impractical or costly to incorporate understudied social groups in debiasing. We propose that the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), a theoretical framework developed in social psychology for understanding the content of stereotypes, which structures stereotype content along two psychological dimensions - 'warmth' and 'competence' - can help debiasing efforts to become social-group-agnostic by capturing the underlying connection between bias and stereotypes. Using only pairs of terms for warmth (e.g., 'genuine'-'fake') and competence (e.g.,'smart'-'stupid'), we perform debiasing with established methods and find that, across gender, race, and age, SCM-based debiasing performs comparably to group-specific debiasing","No"

However, many times these models systematically fail on tail data or rare groups not obvious in aggregate evaluation. Identifying such problematic data groups is even more challenging when there are no explicit labels (e.g., ethnicity, gender, etc.) and further compounded for NLP datasets due to the lack of visual features to characterize failure modes (e.g., Asian males, animals indoors, waterbirds on land, etc.).

While dropout proves to be an effective antidote by randomly dropping a proportion of units, existing research has not examined its effect on the self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we investigate this problem through self-attention attribution and find that dropping attention positions with low attribution scores can accelerate training and increase the risk of overfitting. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attribution-Driven Dropout (AD-DROP), which randomly discards some high-attribution positions to encourage the model to make predictions by relying more on low-attribution positions to reduce overfitting. We also develop a cross-tuning strategy to alternate fine-tuning and AD-DROP to avoid dropping high-attribution positions excessively. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show that AD-DROP yields consistent improvements over baselines. Analysis further confirms that AD-DROP serves as a strategic regularizer to prevent overfitting during fine-tuning.","No"

This work instead adopts the linguistic framework of Questions Under Discussion (QUD) for discourse analysis and seeks to derive QUD structures automatically. QUD views each sentence as an answer to a question triggered in prior context; thus, we characterize relationships between sentences as free-form questions, in contrast to exhaustive fine-grained taxonomies. We develop the first-of-its-kind QUD parser that derives a dependency structure of questions over full documents, trained using a large question-answering dataset DCQA annotated in a manner consistent with the QUD framework. Importantly, data collection is easily crowdsourced using DCQA's paradigm. We show that this leads to a parser attaining strong performance according to human evaluation. We illustrate how our QUD structure is distinct from RST trees, and demonstrate the utility of QUD analysis in the context of document simplification. Our findings show that QUD parsing is an appealing alternative for automatic discourse processing.","No"
"Hate-CLIPper: Multimodal Hateful Meme Classification based on Cross-modal Interaction of CLIP Features","Gokul Karthik Kumar, Karthik Nanadakumar",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05916","Hateful memes are a growing menace on social media. While the image and its corresponding text in a meme are related, they do not necessarily convey the same meaning when viewed individually. Hence, detecting hateful memes requires careful consideration of both visual and textual information. Multimodal pre-training can be beneficial for this task because it effectively captures the relationship between the image and the text by representing them in a similar feature space. Furthermore, it is essential to model the interactions between the image and text features through intermediate fusion. Most existing methods either employ multimodal pre-training or intermediate fusion, but not both. In this work, we propose the Hate-CLIPper architecture, which explicitly models the cross-modal interactions between the image and text representations obtained using Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) encoders via a feature interaction matrix (FIM). A simple classifier based on the FIM representation is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Hateful Memes Challenge (HMC) dataset with an AUROC of 85.8, which even surpasses the human performance of 82.65. Experiments on other meme datasets such as Propaganda Memes and TamilMemes also demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach. Finally, we analyze the interpretability of the FIM representation and show that cross-modal interactions can indeed facilitate the learning of meaningful concepts.

The proposed unsupervised approach requires only a small number of keywords describing the respective topics and no labeled document. Existing approaches either heavily relied on a large amount of additionally encoded world knowledge or on term-document frequencies. Contrariwise, we introduce a method that learns jointly embedded document and word vectors solely from the unlabeled document dataset in order to find documents that are semantically similar to the topics described by the keywords. The proposed method requires almost no text preprocessing but is simultaneously effective at retrieving relevant documents with high probability. When successively retrieving documents on different predefined topics from publicly available and commonly used datasets, we achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.95 on one dataset and 0.92 on another. Further, our method can be used for multiclass document classification, without the need to assign labels to the dataset in advance. Compared with an unsupervised classification baseline, we increased F1 scores from 76.6 to 82.7 and from 61.0 to 75.1 on the respective datasets.

Along with the challenge, we also provide the baseline system performance for reference. As a result, more than 40 teams participated in this challenge, and the winner team achieved 16.70% Mixture Error Rate (MER) performance on the test set and has achieved 9.8% MER absolute improvement compared with the baseline system. In this paper, we will describe the datasets, the associated baselines system and the requirements, and summarize the CSASR challenge results and major techniques and tricks used in the submitted systems.","No"
"Federated Continual Learning for Text Classification via Selective Inter-client Transfer","Yatin Chaudhary, Pranav Rai, Matthias Schubert, Hinrich Sch\'utze, Pankaj Gupta",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06101","In this work, we combine the two paradigms: Federated Learning (FL) and Continual Learning (CL) for text classification task in cloud-edge continuum. The objective of Federated Continual Learning (FCL) is to improve deep learning models over life time at each client by (relevant and efficient) knowledge transfer without sharing data. Here, we address challenges in minimizing inter-client interference while knowledge sharing due to heterogeneous tasks across clients in FCL setup. In doing so, we propose a novel framework, Federated Selective Inter-client Transfer (FedSeIT) which selectively combines model parameters of foreign clients. To further maximize knowledge transfer, we assess domain overlap and select informative tasks from the sequence of historical tasks at each foreign client while preserving privacy. Evaluating against the baselines, we show improved performance, a gain of (average) 12.4\% in text classification over a sequence of tasks using five datasets from diverse domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies FCL to NLP.","No"

Thus, our versatile dataset can be used for both question and distractor generation, as well as to explore new challenges such as question format conversion. Furthermore, 903 questions are accompanied by their cognitive complexity level as per Bloom's taxonomy. All questions have been generated by educational experts rather than crowd workers to ensure they are maintaining educational and learning standards.

"Pruning Pre-trained Language Models Without Fine-Tuning","Ting Jiang, Deqing Wang, Fuzhen Zhuang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06210","To overcome the overparameterized problem in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), pruning is widely used as a simple and straightforward compression method by directly removing unimportant weights. Previous first-order methods successfully compress PLMs to extremely high sparsity with little performance drop. These methods, such as movement pruning, use first-order information to prune PLMs while fine-tuning the remaining weights. In this work, we argue fine-tuning is redundant for first-order pruning, since first-order pruning is sufficient to converge PLMs to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. Under this motivation, we propose Static Model Pruning (SMP), which only uses first-order pruning to adapt PLMs to downstream tasks while achieving the target sparsity level. In addition, we also design a new masking function and training objective to further improve SMP. Extensive experiments at various sparsity levels show SMP has significant improvements over first-order and zero-order methods. Unlike previous first-order methods, SMP is also applicable to low sparsity and outperforms zero-order methods. Meanwhile, SMP is more parameter efficient than other methods due to it does not require fine-tuning.","No"

We formalise this task and call it visually prompted keyword localisation (VPKL): given an image of a keyword, detect and predict where in an utterance the keyword occurs. To do VPKL, we propose a speech-vision model with a novel localising attention mechanism which we train with a new keyword sampling scheme. We show that these innovations give improvements in VPKL over an existing speech-vision model. We also compare to a visual bag-of-words (BoW) model where images are automatically tagged with visual labels and paired with unlabelled speech. Although this visual BoW can be queried directly with a written keyword (while our's takes image queries), our new model still outperforms the visual BoW in both detection and localisation, giving a 16% relative improvement in localisation F1.","No"

"A context-aware knowledge transferring strategy for CTC-based ASR","Ke-Han Lu, Kuan-Yu Chen",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06244","Non-autoregressive automatic speech recognition (ASR) modeling has received increasing attention recently because of its fast decoding speed and superior performance. Among representatives, methods based on the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) are still a dominating stream. However, the theoretically inherent flaw, the assumption of independence between tokens, creates a performance barrier for the school of works. To mitigate the challenge, we propose a context-aware knowledge transferring strategy, consisting of a knowledge transferring module and a context-aware training strategy, for CTC-based ASR. The former is designed to distill linguistic information from a pre-trained language model, and the latter is framed to modulate the limitations caused by the conditional independence assumption. As a result, a knowledge-injected context-aware CTC-based ASR built upon the wav2vec2.0 is presented in this paper.

Building on such insights, we argue that contemporary methods for machine learning are prejudiced towards dominant and hegemonic histories. Employing the example of neopronouns, we show that by surfacing marginalized histories within contemporary conditions, we can create models that better represent the lived realities of traditionally marginalized and excluded communities.","No"

Thus we should separate the commonsense knowledge acquisition and inference over commonsense knowledge as two separate tasks. In this work, we focus on investigating models' commonsense inference capabilities from two perspectives: (1) Whether models can know if the knowledge they have is enough to solve the task; (2) Whether models can develop commonsense inference capabilities that generalize across commonsense tasks. We first align commonsense tasks with relevant knowledge from commonsense knowledge bases and ask humans to annotate whether the knowledge is enough or not. Then, we convert different commonsense tasks into a unified question answering format to evaluate models' generalization capabilities. We name the benchmark as Commonsense Inference with Knowledge-in-the-loop Question Answering (CIKQA).","No"

We present a new approach in which large language models are utilized to generate source documents that allow predicting, given a high-level event definition, the specific events, arguments, and relations between them to construct a schema that describes the complex event in its entirety. Using our model, complete schemas on any topic can be generated on-the-fly without any manual data collection, i.e., in a zero-shot manner. Moreover, we develop efficient methods to extract pertinent information from texts and demonstrate in a series of experiments that these schemas are considered to be more complete than human-curated ones in the majority of examined scenarios. Finally, we show that this framework is comparable in performance with previous supervised schema induction methods that rely on collecting real texts while being more general and flexible without the need for a predefined ontology.","No"

"Towards Generalized and Explainable Long-Range Context Representation for Dialogue Systems","Suvodip Dey, Maunendra Sankar Desarkar, P. K. Srijith",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06282","Context representation is crucial to both dialogue understanding and generation. Recently, the most popular method for dialog context representation is to concatenate the last-$k$ previous utterances as context and use a large transformer-based model to generate the next response. However, this method may not be ideal for conversations containing long-range dependencies. In this work, we propose DialoGX, a novel encoder-decoder based framework for conversational response generation with a generalized and explainable context representation that can look beyond the last-$k$ utterances. Hence the method is adaptive to conversations with long-range dependencies. Our proposed solution is based on two key ideas: a) computing a dynamic representation of the entire context, and b) finding the previous utterances that are relevant for generating the next response. Instead of last-$k$ utterances, DialoGX uses the concatenation of the dynamic context vector and encoding of the most relevant utterances as input which enables it to represent conversations of any length in a compact and generalized fashion. We conduct our experiments on DailyDialog, a popular open-domain chit-chat dataset. DialoGX achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art models on the automated metrics. We also justify our context representation through the lens of psycholinguistics and show that the relevance score of previous utterances agrees well with human cognition which makes DialoGX explainable as well.","No"

Historically the SLP task has been broken into two steps; Firstly, translating from a spoken language sentence to a gloss sequence and secondly, producing a sign language video given a sequence of glosses. In this paper we apply Natural Language Processing techniques to the first step of the SLP pipeline. We use language models such as BERT and Word2Vec to create better sentence level embeddings, and apply several tokenization techniques, demonstrating how these improve performance on the low resource translation task of Text to Gloss. We introduce Text to HamNoSys (T2H) translation, and show the advantages of using a phonetic representation for sign language translation rather than a sign level gloss representation. Furthermore, we use HamNoSys to extract the hand shape of a sign and use this as additional supervision during training, further increasing the performance on T2H.

However, such systems all succumb to the same problem: making hallucinated references to non-existent prior reports. Such hallucinations occur because these models are trained on datasets of real-world patient reports that inherently refer to priors. To this end, we propose two methods to remove references to priors in radiology reports: (1) a GPT-3-based few-shot approach to rewrite medical reports without references to priors; and (2) a BioBERT-based token classification approach to directly remove words referring to priors. We use the aforementioned approaches to modify MIMIC-CXR, a publicly available dataset of chest X-rays and their associated free-text radiology reports; we then retrain CXR-RePaiR, a radiology report generation system, on the adapted MIMIC-CXR dataset. We find that our re-trained model--which we call CXR-ReDonE--outperforms previous report generation methods on clinical metrics, achieving an average BERTScore of 0.2351 (2.57% absolute improvement).

In this study, we designed a four-layer multilayer perceptron neural network (MPNN) model to predict the clinical citation count of biomedical papers in the future by using 9,822,620 biomedical papers published from 1985 to 2005. We extracted ninety-one paper features from three dimensions as the input of the model, including twenty-one features in the paper dimension, thirty-five in the reference dimension, and thirty-five in the citing paper dimension. In each dimension, the features can be classified into three categories, i.e., the citation-related features, the clinical translation-related features, and the topic-related features. Besides, in the paper dimension, we also considered the features that have previously been demonstrated to be related to the citation counts of research papers. The results showed that the proposed MPNN model outperformed the other five baseline models, and the features in the reference dimension were the most important.","No"

Prior work on closed-book QA either directly finetunes or prompts a pretrained language model (LM) to leverage the stored knowledge. However, they do not fully exploit the parameterized knowledge. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage, closed-book QA framework which employs a coarse-to-fine approach to extract relevant knowledge and answer a question. Our approach first generates a related context for a given question by prompting a pretrained LM. We then prompt the same LM for answer prediction using the generated context and the question. Additionally, to eliminate failure caused by context uncertainty, we marginalize over generated contexts. Experimental results on three QA benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms previous closed-book QA methods (e.g. exact matching 68.6% vs. 55.3%), and is on par with open-book methods that exploit external knowledge sources (e.g. 68.6% vs. 68.0%). Our method is able to better exploit the stored knowledge in pretrained LMs without adding extra learnable parameters or needing finetuning, and paves the way for hybrid models that integrate pretrained LMs with external knowledge.","No"

In the context of marginal abuse modeling on Twitter, such disproportionate penalization poses the risk of reduced visibility, where marginalized communities lose the opportunity to voice their opinion on the platform. Current approaches to algorithmic harm mitigation, and bias detection for NLP models are often very ad hoc and subject to human bias. We make two main contributions in this paper. First, we design a novel methodology, which provides a principled approach to detecting and measuring the severity of potential harms associated with a text-based model. Second, we apply our methodology to audit Twitter's English marginal abuse model, which is used for removing amplification eligibility of marginally abusive content. Without utilizing demographic labels or dialect classifiers, we are still able to detect and measure the severity of issues related to the over-penalization of the speech of marginalized communities, such as the use of reclaimed speech, counterspeech, and identity related terms. In order to mitigate the associated harms, we experiment with adding additional true negative examples and find that doing so provides improvements to our fairness metrics without large degradations in model performance.","No"

In this paper, wepropose a novel metric based on Text-to-Audio Grounding (TAG), which is, useful for evaluating cross modal tasks like AAC. Experiments on publicly available AAC data-set shows our evaluation metric to perform better compared to existing metrics used in NL text and image captioning literature.","No"
"Extractive Question Answering on Queries in Hindi and Tamil","Adhitya Thirumala, Elisa Ferracane",9,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06356","Indic languages like Hindi and Tamil are underrepresented in the natural language processing (NLP) field compared to languages like English. Due to this underrepresentation, performance on NLP tasks (such as search algorithms) in Indic languages are inferior to their English counterparts. This difference disproportionately affects those who come from lower socioeconomic statuses because they consume the most Internet content in local languages. The goal of this project is to build an NLP model that performs better than pre-existing models for the task of extractive question-answering (QA) on a public dataset in Hindi and Tamil. Extractive QA is an NLP task where answers to questions are extracted from a corresponding body of text. To build the best solution, we used three different models. The first model is an unmodified cross-lingual version of the NLP model RoBERTa, known as XLM-RoBERTa, that is pretrained on 100 languages. The second model is based on the pretrained RoBERTa model with an extra classification head for the question answering, but we used a custom Indic tokenizer, then optimized hyperparameters and fine tuned on the Indic dataset. The third model is based on XLM-RoBERTa, but with extra finetuning and training on the Indic dataset. We hypothesize the third model will perform best because of the variety of languages the XLM-RoBERTa model has been pretrained on and the additional finetuning on the Indic dataset. This hypothesis was proven wrong because the paired RoBERTa models performed the best as the training data used was most specific to the task performed as opposed to the XLM-RoBERTa models which had much data that was not in either Hindi or Tamil.","No"
"Probing Commonsense Knowledge in Pre-trained Language Models with Sense-level Precision and Expanded Vocabulary","Daniel Loureiro, Al\'ipio M\'ario Jorge",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06376","Progress on commonsense reasoning is usually measured from performance improvements on Question Answering tasks designed to require commonsense knowledge. However, fine-tuning large Language Models (LMs) on these specific tasks does not directly evaluate commonsense learned during pre-training. The most direct assessments of commonsense knowledge in pre-trained LMs are arguably cloze-style tasks targeting commonsense assertions (e.g., A pen is used for [MASK].). However, this approach is restricted by the LM's vocabulary available for masked predictions, and its precision is subject to the context provided by the assertion. In this work, we present a method for enriching LMs with a grounded sense inventory (i.e., WordNet) available at the vocabulary level, without further training. This modification augments the prediction space of cloze-style prompts to the size of a large ontology while enabling finer-grained (sense-level) queries and predictions. In order to evaluate LMs with higher precision, we propose SenseLAMA, a cloze-style task featuring verbalized relations from disambiguated triples sourced from WordNet, WikiData, and ConceptNet. Applying our method to BERT, producing a WordNet-enriched version named SynBERT, we find that LMs can learn non-trivial commonsense knowledge from self-supervision, covering numerous relations, and more effectively than comparable similarity-based approaches.","No"

Our results provide a simple yet strong baseline for future work, highlight the importance of parameter tuning for baselines, and even improve the performance of the state-of-the-art second-order pruning method in this setting.","No"
"On Text Style Transfer via Style Masked Language Models","Sharan Narasimhan, Pooja Shekar, Suvodip Dey, Maunendra Sankar Desarkar",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06394","Text Style Transfer (TST) is performable through approaches such as latent space disentanglement, cycle-consistency losses, prototype editing etc. The prototype editing approach, which is known to be quite successful in TST, involves two key phases a) Masking of source style-associated tokens and b) Reconstruction of this source-style masked sentence conditioned with the target style. We follow a similar transduction method, in which we transpose the more difficult direct source to target TST task to a simpler Style-Masked Language Model (SMLM) Task, wherein, similar to BERT \cite{bert}, the goal of our model is now to reconstruct the source sentence from its style-masked version. We arrive at the SMLM mechanism naturally by formulating prototype editing/ transduction methods in a probabilistic framework, where TST resolves into estimating a hypothetical parallel dataset from a partially observed parallel dataset, wherein each domain is assumed to have a common latent style-masked prior. To generate this style-masked prior, we use 'Explainable Attention' as our choice of attribution for a more precise style-masking step and also introduce a cost-effective and accurate 'Attribution-Surplus' method of determining the position of masks from any arbitrary attribution model in O(1) time. We empirically show that this non-generational approach well suites the 'content preserving' criteria for a task like TST, even for a complex style like Discourse Manipulation. Our model, the Style MLM, outperforms strong TST baselines and is on par with state-of-the-art TST models, which use complex architectures and orders of more parameters.","No"

Existing research, on the other hand, is mostly focused on the English language, with little work on low-resource languages. Though sentiment analysis, particularly the EC in English, has received a lot of attention in recent years, little study has been done in the context of Bangla, one of the world's most widely spoken languages. We propose a complete set of approaches for identifying and extracting emotions from Bangla texts in this research. We provide a Bangla emotion classifier for six classes (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise) from Bangla words, using transformer-based models which exhibit phenomenal results in recent days, especially for high resource languages. The 'Unified Bangla Multi-class Emotion Corpus (UBMEC)' is used to assess the performance of our models. UBMEC was created by combining two previously released manually labeled datasets of Bangla comments on 6-emotion classes with fresh manually tagged Bangla comments created by us.

"PriMeSRL-Eval: A Practical Quality Metric for Semantic Role Labeling Systems Evaluation","Ishan Jindal, Alexandre Rademaker, Khoi-Nguyen Tran, Huaiyu Zhu, Hiroshi Kanayama, Marina Danilevsky, Yunyao Li",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06408","Semantic role labeling (SRL) identifies the predicate-argument structure in a sentence. This task is usually accomplished in four steps: predicate identification, predicate sense disambiguation, argument identification, and argument classification. Errors introduced at one step propagate to later steps. Unfortunately, the existing SRL evaluation scripts do not consider the full effect of this error propagation aspect. They either evaluate arguments independent of predicate sense (CoNLL09) or do not evaluate predicate sense at all (CoNLL05), yielding an inaccurate SRL model performance on the argument classification task. In this paper, we address key practical issues with existing evaluation scripts and propose a more strict SRL evaluation metric PriMeSRL. We observe that by employing PriMeSRL, the quality evaluation of all SoTA SRL models drops significantly, and their relative rankings also change. We also show that PriMeSRLsuccessfully penalizes actual failures in SoTA SRL models.","No"

In spite of this resounding success, the usability of LMs is constrained by computational and time complexity, along with their increasing size; an issue that has been referred to as `overparameterisation'. Different strategies have been proposed in the literature to alleviate these problems, with the aim to create effective compact models that nearly match the performance of their bloated counterparts with negligible performance losses. One of the most popular techniques in this area of research is model distillation. Another potent but underutilised technique is cross-layer parameter sharing. In this work, we combine these two strategies and present MiniALBERT, a technique for converting the knowledge of fully parameterised LMs (such as BERT) into a compact recursive student. In addition, we investigate the application of bottleneck adapters for layer-wise adaptation of our recursive student, and also explore the efficacy of adapter tuning for fine-tuning of compact models.

The constraint brought by this assumption is weak, and a good sentence representation should also be able to reconstruct the original sentence fragments. Therefore, this paper proposes an information-aggregated contrastive learning framework for learning unsupervised sentence embeddings, termed InfoCSE. InfoCSE forces the representation of [CLS] positions to aggregate denser sentence information by introducing an additional Masked language model task and a well-designed network. We evaluate the proposed InfoCSE on several benchmark datasets w.r.t the semantic text similarity (STS) task.

While advanced FSIC methods are similar in using pretrained language models to encode texts and nearest neighbour-based inference for classification, these methods differ in details. They start from different pretrained text encoders, use different encoding architectures with varying similarity functions, and adopt different training regimes. Coupling these mostly independent design decisions and the lack of accompanying ablation studies are big obstacle to identify the factors that drive the reported FSIC performance. We study these details across three key dimensions: (1) Encoding architectures: Cross-Encoder vs Bi-Encoders; (2) Similarity function: Parameterized (i.e., trainable) functions vs non-parameterized function; (3) Training regimes: Episodic meta-learning vs the straightforward (i.e., non-episodic) training. Our experimental results on seven FSIC benchmarks reveal three important findings. First, the unexplored combination of the cross-encoder architecture (with parameterized similarity scoring function) and episodic meta-learning consistently yields the best FSIC performance. Second, Episodic training yields a more robust FSIC classifier than non-episodic one. Third, in meta-learning methods, splitting an episode to support and query sets is not a must. Our findings paves the way for conducting state-of-the-art research in FSIC and more importantly raise the community's attention to details of FSIC methods.

"Can Pretrained Language Models (Yet) Reason Deductively?","Zhangdie Yuan, Songbo Hu, Ivan Vuli\'c, Anna Korhonen and Zaiqiao Meng",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06442","Acquiring factual knowledge with Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) has attracted increasing attention, showing promising performance in many knowledge-intensive tasks. Their good performance has led the community to believe that the models do possess a modicum of reasoning competence rather than merely memorising the knowledge. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the learnable deductive (also known as explicit) reasoning capability of PLMs. Through a series of controlled experiments, we posit two main findings. (i) PLMs inadequately generalise learned logic rules and perform inconsistently against simple adversarial surface form edits. (ii) While the deductive reasoning fine-tuning of PLMs does improve their performance on reasoning over unseen knowledge facts, it results in catastrophically forgetting the previously learnt knowledge. Our main results suggest that PLMs cannot yet perform reliable deductive reasoning, demonstrating the importance of controlled examinations and probing of PLMs' reasoning abilities; we reach beyond (misleading) task performance, revealing that PLMs are still far from human-level reasoning capabilities, even for simple deductive tasks.","No"

"Are Sample-Efficient NLP Models More Robust?","Nelson F. Liu and Ananya Kumar and Percy Liang and Robin Jia",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06456","Recent work has observed that pre-trained models have higher out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness when they are exposed to less in-distribution (ID) training data (Radford et al., 2021). In particular, zero-shot models (e.g., GPT-3 and CLIP) have higher robustness than conventionally fine-tuned models, but these robustness gains fade as zero-shot models are fine-tuned on more ID data. We study this relationship between sample efficiency and robustness -- if two models have the same ID performance, does the model trained on fewer examples (higher sample efficiency) perform better OOD (higher robustness)? Surprisingly, experiments across three tasks, 23 total ID-OOD settings, and 14 models do not reveal a consistent relationship between sample efficiency and robustness -- while models with higher sample efficiency are sometimes more robust, most often there is no change in robustness, with some cases even showing decreased robustness. Since results vary on a case-by-case basis, we conduct detailed case studies of two particular ID-OOD pairs (SST-2 -> IMDb sentiment and SNLI -> HANS) to better understand why better sample efficiency may or may not yield higher robustness; attaining such an understanding requires case-by-case analysis of why models are not robust on a particular ID-OOD setting and how modeling techniques affect model capabilities.","No"
"Better Smatch = Better Parser? AMR evaluation is not so simple anymore","Juri Opitz and Anette Frank",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06461","Recently, astonishing advances have been observed in AMR parsing, as measured by the structural Smatch metric. In fact, today's systems achieve performance levels that seem to surpass estimates of human inter annotator agreement (IAA). Therefore, it is unclear how well Smatch (still) relates to human estimates of parse quality, as in this situation potentially fine-grained errors of similar weight may impact the AMR's meaning to different degrees. We conduct an analysis of two popular and strong AMR parsers that -- according to Smatch -- reach quality levels on par with human IAA, and assess how human quality ratings relate to Smatch and other AMR metrics. Our main findings are: i) While high Smatch scores indicate otherwise, we find that AMR parsing is far from being solved: we frequently find structurally small, but semantically unacceptable errors that substantially distort sentence meaning. ii) Considering high-performance parsers, better Smatch scores may not necessarily indicate consistently better parsing quality. To obtain a meaningful and comprehensive assessment of quality differences of parse(r)s, we recommend augmenting evaluations with macro statistics, use of additional metrics, and more human analysis.","No"
"Visual Language Maps for Robot Navigation","Chenguang Huang, Oier Mees, Andy Zeng, Wolfram Burgard",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05714","Grounding language to the visual observations of a navigating agent can be performed using off-the-shelf visual-language models pretrained on Internet-scale data (e.g., image captions). While this is useful for matching images to natural language descriptions of object goals, it remains disjoint from the process of mapping the environment, so that it lacks the spatial precision of classic geometric maps. To address this problem, we propose VLMaps, a spatial map representation that directly fuses pretrained visual-language features with a 3D reconstruction of the physical world. VLMaps can be autonomously built from video feed on robots using standard exploration approaches and enables natural language indexing of the map without additional labeled data. Specifically, when combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can be used to (i) translate natural language commands into a sequence of open-vocabulary navigation goals (which, beyond prior work, can be spatial by construction, e.g., 'in between the sofa and TV' or 'three meters to the right of the chair') directly localized in the map, and (ii) can be shared among multiple robots with different embodiments to generate new obstacle maps on-the-fly (by using a list of obstacle categories). Extensive experiments carried out in simulated and real world environments show that VLMaps enable navigation according to more complex language instructions than existing methods.

Bailey",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05760","Efforts by foreign actors to influence public opinion have gained considerable attention because of their potential to impact democratic elections. Thus, the ability to identify and counter sources of disinformation is increasingly becoming a top priority for government entities in order to protect the integrity of democratic processes. This study presents a method of identifying Russian disinformation bots on Twitter using centering resonance analysis and Clauset-Newman-Moore community detection. The data reflect a significant degree of discursive dissimilarity between known Russian disinformation bots and a control set of Twitter users during the timeframe of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. The data also demonstrate statistically significant classification capabilities (MCC = 0.9070) based on community clustering. The prediction algorithm is very effective at identifying true positives (bots), but is not able to resolve true negatives (non-bots) because of the lack of discursive similarity between control users. This leads to a highly sensitive means of identifying propagators of disinformation with a high degree of discursive similarity on Twitter, with implications for limiting the spread of disinformation that could impact democratic processes.","No"

In general, benchmarks follow the unspoken utilitarian principles, where the systems are ranked based on their mean average score over task-specific metrics. Such aggregation procedure has been viewed as a sub-optimal evaluation protocol, which may have created the illusion of progress.

We demonstrate that our approach can be efficiently utilised to draw new insights on benchmarking in several ML sub-fields and identify the best-performing systems in research and development case studies. The Vote'n'Rank's procedures are more robust than the mean average while being able to handle missing performance scores and determine conditions under which the system becomes the winner.","No"

State-of-the-art multimodal models, such as CLIP and VisualBERT, are pre-trained on datasets with the text paired with images. Although the results obtained by these models are promising, pre-training and sentiment analysis fine-tuning tasks of these models are computationally expensive.

Our proposal achieved competitive results using a more straightforward alternative fine-tuning strategy that leverages different pre-trained unimodal models and efficiently combines them in a multimodal space. Moreover, our proposal allows flexibility when incorporating any pre-trained model for texts and images during the joint fine-tuning stage, being especially interesting for sentiment classification in low-resource scenarios.","No"

Specifically, we compared using soft and hard target distillation to train large-scaleRNN-T models on the LibriSpeech/LibriLight public dataset (60k hours) and our in-house data (600k hours). We found that hard tar-gets are more effective when the teacher and student have different architecture, such as large teacher and small streaming student. On the other hand, soft target distillation works better in self-training scenario like iterative large teacher training.

Prior action anticipation work mostly treats this as a vision modality problem, where the models learn the task information primarily from the video features in the target action anticipation datasets. In this work, we propose a method to make use of the text-modality that is available during the training, to bring in complementary information that is not present in the target action anticipation datasets. In particular, we leverage pre-trained language models to build a text-modality teacher that is able to predict future actions based on text labels of the past actions extracted from the input video. To further adapt the teacher to the target domain (cooking), we also pretrain the teacher on textual instructions from a recipes dataset (Recipe1M). Then, we distill the knowledge gained by the text-modality teacher into a vision-modality student to further improve it's performance. We empirically evaluate this simple cross-modal distillation strategy on two video datasets EGTEA-GAZE+ and EPIC-KITCHEN 55. Distilling this text-modality knowledge into a strong vision model (Anticipative Vision Transformer) yields consistent gains across both datasets, 3.5% relative improvement on top1 class mean recall for EGTEA-GAZE+, 7.2% on top5 many-shot class mean recall for EPIC-KITCHEN 55 and achieves new state-of-the-results.","No"

However, existing medical image-text joint learning methods are limited by instance or local supervision analysis, ignoring disease-level semantic correspondences. In this paper, we present a novel Multi-Granularity Cross-modal Alignment (MGCA) framework for generalized medical visual representation learning by harnessing the naturally exhibited semantic correspondences between medical image and radiology reports at three different levels, i.e., pathological region-level, instance-level, and disease-level. Specifically, we first incorporate the instance-wise alignment module by maximizing the agreement between image-report pairs. Further, for token-wise alignment, we introduce a bidirectional cross-attention strategy to explicitly learn the matching between fine-grained visual tokens and text tokens, followed by contrastive learning to align them. More important, to leverage the high-level inter-subject relationship semantic (e.g., disease) correspondences, we design a novel cross-modal disease-level alignment paradigm to enforce the cross-modal cluster assignment consistency. Extensive experimental results on seven downstream medical image datasets covering image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the stable and superior performance of our framework.","No"

Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that the emergence of sparsity is a prevalent phenomenon that occurs for both natural language processing and vision tasks, on both training and evaluation data, for Transformers of various configurations, at layers of all depth levels, as well as for other architectures including MLP-mixers and 2-layer MLPs. We show that sparsity also emerges using training datasets with random labels, or with random inputs, or with infinite amount of data, demonstrating that sparsity is not a result of a specific family of datasets. We discuss how sparsity immediately implies a way to significantly reduce the FLOP count and improve efficiency for Transformers. Moreover, we demonstrate perhaps surprisingly that enforcing an even sparser activation via Top-k thresholding with a small value of k brings a collection of desired but missing properties for Transformers, namely less sensitivity to noisy training data, more robustness to input corruptions, and better calibration for their prediction confidence.","No"
"One does not fit all! On the Complementarity of Vision Encoders for Vision and Language Tasks","Gregor Geigle, Chen Liu, Jonas Pfeiffer and Iryna Gurevych",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06379","Current multimodal models, aimed at solving Vision and Language (V+L) tasks, predominantly repurpose Vision Encoders (VE) as feature extractors. While many VEs -- of different architectures, trained on different data and objectives -- are publicly available, they are not designed for the downstream V+L tasks. Nonetheless, most current work assumes that a \textit{single} pre-trained VE can serve as a general-purpose encoder. In this work, we evaluate whether the information stored within different VEs is complementary, i.e. if providing the model with features from multiple VEs can improve the performance on a target task. We exhaustively experiment with three popular VEs on six downstream V+L tasks and analyze the attention and VE-dropout patterns. Our results and analyses suggest that diverse VEs complement each other, resulting in improved downstream V+L task performance, where the improvements are not due to simple ensemble effects (i.e. the performance does not always improve when increasing the number of encoders). We demonstrate that future VEs, which are not \textit{repurposed}, but explicitly \textit{designed} for V+L tasks, have the potential of improving performance on the target V+L tasks.","No"

Thus, in this paper we make the following contributions: (1) We demonstrate that Retrieval Augmentation of queries provides LLMs with valuable additional context enabling improved understanding. While Retrieval Augmentation typically increases latency of LMs (thus hurting distillation efficacy), (2) we provide a practical and effective way of distilling Retrieval Augmentation LLMs. Specifically, we use a novel two-stage distillation approach that allows us to carry over the gains of retrieval augmentation, without suffering the increased compute typically associated with it.

However, these systems model sequence labeling as a sequence prediction task causing a divergence from its well-established token-level tagging formulation. We build compositional end-to-end SLU systems that explicitly separate the added complexity of recognizing spoken mentions in SLU from the NLU task of sequence labeling. By relying on intermediate decoders trained for ASR, our end-to-end systems transform the input modality from speech to token-level representations that can be used in the traditional sequence labeling framework. This composition of ASR and NLU formulations in our end-to-end SLU system offers direct compatibility with pre-trained ASR and NLU systems, allows performance monitoring of individual components and enables the use of globally normalized losses like CRF, making them attractive in practical scenarios.

Through extensive experiments and human evaluation we demonstrate the potential of our method to generate text while controlling style. We find that style-specific datastores improve generation performance, though results vary greatly across styles, and the effect of pretraining data and specific styles should be explored in future work.","No"
"Evaluating context-invariance in unsupervised speech representations","Mark Hallap, Emmanuel Dupoux, Ewan Dunbar",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15775","Unsupervised speech representations have taken off, with benchmarks (SUPERB, ZeroSpeech) demonstrating major progress on semi-supervised speech recognition, speech synthesis, and speech-only language modelling. Inspiration comes from the promise of ``discovering the phonemes'' of a language or a similar low-bitrate encoding. However, one of the critical properties of phoneme transcriptions is context-invariance: the phonetic context of a speech sound can have massive influence on the way it is pronounced, while the text remains stable. This is what allows tokens of the same word to have the same transcriptions -- key to language understanding. Current benchmarks do not measure context-invariance. We develop a new version of the ZeroSpeech ABX benchmark that measures context-invariance, and apply it to recent self-supervised representations. We demonstrate that the context-independence of representations is predictive of the stability of word-level representations. We suggest research concentrate on improving context-independence of self-supervised and unsupervised representations.","No"

Developing a model to rewrite conversational questions into self-contained ones is an emerging solution in industry settings as it allows using existing single-turn QA systems to avoid training a CQA model from scratch. Previous work trains rewriting models using human rewrites as supervision. However, such objectives are disconnected with QA models and therefore more human-like rewrites do not guarantee better QA performance. In this paper we propose using QA feedback to supervise the rewriting model with reinforcement learning. Experiments show that our approach can effectively improve QA performance over baselines for both extractive and retrieval QA. Furthermore, human evaluation shows that our method can generate more accurate and detailed rewrites when compared to human annotations.","No"

"Improving Zero-Shot Multilingual Translation with Universal Representations and Cross-Mappings","Shuhao Gu, Yang Feng",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15851","The many-to-many multilingual neural machine translation can translate between language pairs unseen during training, i.e., zero-shot translation. Improving zero-shot translation requires the model to learn universal representations and cross-mapping relationships to transfer the knowledge learned on the supervised directions to the zero-shot directions. In this work, we propose the state mover's distance based on the optimal theory to model the difference of the representations output by the encoder. Then, we bridge the gap between the semantic-equivalent representations of different languages at the token level by minimizing the proposed distance to learn universal representations. Besides, we propose an agreement-based training scheme, which can help the model make consistent predictions based on the semantic-equivalent sentences to learn universal cross-mapping relationships for all translation directions. The experimental results on diverse multilingual datasets show that our method can improve consistently compared with the baseline system and other contrast methods. The analysis proves that our method can better align the semantic space and improve the prediction consistency.","No"

In this paper, we explore the importance of lexical and semantic matching in the context of items retrieved by $k$NN-LM. We find two trends: (1) the presence of large overlapping $n$-grams between the datastore and evaluation set plays an important factor in strong performance, even when the datastore is derived from the training data; and (2) the $k$NN-LM is most beneficial when retrieved items have high semantic similarity with the query.

Speech input is first force-aligned with texts, then pre-processed to a token sequence, including words and associated phrase break information. The token sequence is then fed into the pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline. In pre-training, a replaced break token detection module is trained with token data where each token has a certain percentage chance to be randomly replaced.

"Debiasing Masks: A New Framework for Shortcut Mitigation in NLU","Johannes Mario Meissner, Saku Sugawara, Akiko Aizawa",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16079","Debiasing language models from unwanted behaviors in Natural Language Understanding tasks is a topic with rapidly increasing interest in the NLP community. Spurious statistical correlations in the data allow models to perform shortcuts and avoid uncovering more advanced and desirable linguistic features. A multitude of effective debiasing approaches has been proposed, but flexibility remains a major issue. For the most part, models must be retrained to find a new set of weights with debiased behavior. We propose a new debiasing method in which we identify debiased pruning masks that can be applied to a finetuned model. This enables the selective and conditional application of debiasing behaviors. We assume that bias is caused by a certain subset of weights in the network; our method is, in essence, a mask search to identify and remove biased weights. Our masks show equivalent or superior performance to the standard counterparts, while offering important benefits. Pruning masks can be stored with high efficiency in memory, and it becomes possible to switch among several debiasing behaviors (or revert back to the original biased model) at inference time. Finally, it opens the doors to further research on how biases are acquired by studying the generated masks. For example, we observed that the early layers and attention heads were pruned more aggressively, possibly hinting towards the location in which biases may be encoded.","No"

Where syntactic structure is explicitly modeled, prior work has relied predominantly on context-free grammars (CFG), yet such formalisms are not sufficiently expressive for human languages. Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCGs) are sufficiently expressive directly compositional models of grammar with flexible constituency that affords incremental interpretation. In this work we evaluate whether a more expressive CCG provides a better model than a CFG for human neural signals collected with fMRI while participants listen to an audiobook story. We further test between variants of CCG that differ in how they handle optional adjuncts. These evaluations are carried out against a baseline that includes estimates of next-word predictability from a Transformer neural network language model. Such a comparison reveals unique contributions of CCG structure-building predominantly in the left posterior temporal lobe: CCG-derived measures offer a superior fit to neural signals compared to those derived from a CFG. These effects are spatially distinct from bilateral superior temporal effects that are unique to predictability.

Method developers have staked the efficacy of new topic model variants on automated measures, and their failure to approximate human preferences places these models on uncertain ground. Moreover, existing evaluation paradigms are often divorced from real-world use. Motivated by content analysis as a dominant real-world use case for topic modeling, we analyze two related aspects of topic models that affect their effectiveness and trustworthiness in practice for that purpose: the stability of their estimates and the extent to which the model's discovered categories align with human-determined categories in the data. We find that neural topic models fare worse in both respects compared to an established classical method. We take a step toward addressing both issues in tandem by demonstrating that a straightforward ensembling method can reliably outperform the members of the ensemble.","No"
"Feature Engineering vs BERT on Twitter Data","Ryiaadh Gani, Lisa Chalaguine",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16168","In this paper, we compare the performances of traditional machine learning models using feature engineering and word vectors and the state-of-the-art language model BERT using word embeddings on three datasets. We also consider the time and cost efficiency of feature engineering compared to BERT. From our results we conclude that the use of the BERT model was only worth the time and cost trade-off for one of the three datasets we used for comparison, where the BERT model significantly outperformed any kind of traditional classifier that uses feature vectors, instead of embeddings. Using the BERT model for the other datasets only achieved an increase of 0.03 and 0.05 of accuracy and F1 score respectively, which could be argued makes its use not worth the time and cost of GPU.","No"
"Probing for targeted syntactic knowledge through grammatical error detection","Christopher Davis, Christopher Bryant, Andrew Caines, Marek Rei, Paula Buttery",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16228","Targeted studies testing knowledge of subject-verb agreement (SVA) indicate that pre-trained language models encode syntactic information. We assert that if models robustly encode subject-verb agreement, they should be able to identify when agreement is correct and when it is incorrect. To that end, we propose grammatical error detection as a diagnostic probe to evaluate token-level contextual representations for their knowledge of SVA. We evaluate contextual representations at each layer from five pre-trained English language models: BERT, XLNet, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA. We leverage public annotated training data from both English second language learners and Wikipedia edits, and report results on manually crafted stimuli for subject-verb agreement. We find that masked language models linearly encode information relevant to the detection of SVA errors, while the autoregressive models perform on par with our baseline. However, we also observe a divergence in performance when probes are trained on different training sets, and when they are evaluated on different syntactic constructions, suggesting the information pertaining to SVA error detection is not robustly encoded.","No"

We notice that human reasoning has a dual reasoning framework that consists of an immediate reaction system (system 1) and a delicate reasoning system (system 2), where the entire reasoning is determined by their interaction. This inspires us to develop a cooperative reasoning-induced PLM for solving MWPs, called Cooperative Reasoning (CoRe), resulting in a human-like reasoning architecture with system 1 as the generator and system 2 as the verifier. In our approach, the generator is responsible for generating reasoning paths, and the verifiers are used to supervise the evaluation in order to obtain reliable feedback for the generator. We evaluate our CoRe framework on several mathematical reasoning datasets and achieve decent improvement over state-of-the-art methods, up to 9.8% increase over best baselines.","No"

Furthermore, we introduce a novel way of training Perceivers, with Dynamic Latent Access (DLA), unlocking larger latent spaces without any additional computational overhead. Speech-to-Text Perceivers with DLA can match the performance of a Transformer baseline across three language pairs in MuST-C.

In this work, we propose an improved technique to simulate multi-talker overlapping speech with realistic speech overlaps, where an arbitrary pattern of speech overlaps is represented by a sequence of discrete tokens. With this representation, speech overlapping patterns can be learned from real conversations based on a statistical language model, such as N-gram, which can be then used to generate multi-talker speech for training.

"Residual Adapters for Few-Shot Text-to-Speech Speaker Adaptation","Nobuyuki Morioka, Heiga Zen, Nanxin Chen, Yu Zhang, Yifan Ding",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15868","Adapting a neural text-to-speech (TTS) model to a target speaker typically involves fine-tuning most if not all of the parameters of a pretrained multi-speaker backbone model. However, serving hundreds of fine-tuned neural TTS models is expensive as each of them requires significant footprint and separate computational resources (e.g., accelerators, memory). To scale speaker adapted neural TTS voices to hundreds of speakers while preserving the naturalness and speaker similarity, this paper proposes a parameter-efficient few-shot speaker adaptation, where the backbone model is augmented with trainable lightweight modules called residual adapters. This architecture allows the backbone model to be shared across different target speakers. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve competitive naturalness and speaker similarity compared to the full fine-tuning approaches, while requiring only $\sim$0.1% of the backbone model parameters for each speaker.","No"

"Can Current Explainability Help Provide References in Clinical Notes to Support Humans Annotate Medical Codes?","Byung-Hak Kim, Zhongfen Deng, Philip S. Yu, Varun Ganapathi",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15882","The medical codes prediction problem from clinical notes has received substantial interest in the NLP community, and several recent studies have shown the state-of-the-art (SOTA) code prediction results of full-fledged deep learning-based methods. However, most previous SOTA works based on deep learning are still in early stages in terms of providing textual references and explanations of the predicted codes, despite the fact that this level of explainability of the prediction outcomes is critical to gaining trust from professional medical coders. This raises the important question of how well current explainability methods apply to advanced neural network models such as transformers to predict correct codes and present references in clinical notes that support code prediction. First, we present an explainable Read, Attend, and Code (xRAC) framework and assess two approaches, attention score-based xRAC-ATTN and model-agnostic knowledge-distillation-based xRAC-KD, through simplified but thorough human-grounded evaluations with SOTA transformer-based model, RAC. We find that the supporting evidence text highlighted by xRAC-ATTN is of higher quality than xRAC-KD whereas xRAC-KD has potential advantages in production deployment scenarios. More importantly, we show for the first time that, given the current state of explainability methodologies, using the SOTA medical codes prediction system still requires the expertise and competencies of professional coders, even though its prediction accuracy is superior to that of human coders. This, we believe, is a very meaningful step toward developing explainable and accurate machine learning systems for fully autonomous medical code prediction from clinical notes.","No"

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach, namely UPainting, to unify simple and complex scene image generation, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:leading_samples}. Based on architecture improvements and diverse guidance schedules, UPainting effectively integrates cross-modal guidance from a pretrained image-text matching model into a text conditional diffusion model that utilizes a pretrained Transformer language model as the text encoder. Our key findings is that combining the power of large-scale Transformer language model in understanding language and image-text matching model in capturing cross-modal semantics and style, is effective to improve sample fidelity and image-text alignment of image generation. In this way, UPainting has a more general image generation capability, which can generate images of both simple and complex scenes more effectively. %On the COCO dataset, UPainting achieves much better performance than Stable Diffusion, one of the state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models.

Recent work has used neural models to produce edited speech that is similar to the original speech in terms of clarity, speaker identity, and prosody. However, one limitation of prior work is the usage of finetuning to optimise performance: this requires further model training on data from the target speaker, which is a costly process that may incorporate potentially sensitive data into server-side models. In contrast, this work focuses on the zero-shot approach which avoids finetuning altogether, and instead uses pretrained speaker verification embeddings together with a jointly trained reference encoder to encode utterance-level information that helps capture aspects such as speaker identity and prosody. Subjective listening tests find that both utterance embeddings and a reference encoder improve the continuity of speaker identity and prosody between the edited synthetic speech and unedited original recording in the zero-shot setting.","No"
"Neural Network based Formation of Cognitive Maps of Semantic Spaces and the Emergence of Abstract Concepts","Paul Stoewer, Achim Schilling, Andreas Maier, Patrick Krauss",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16062","The hippocampal-entorhinal complex plays a major role in the organization of memory and thought. The formation of and navigation in cognitive maps of arbitrary mental spaces via place and grid cells can serve as a representation of memories and experiences and their relations to each other. The multi-scale successor representation is proposed to be the mathematical principle underlying place and grid cell computations. Here, we present a neural network, which learns a cognitive map of a semantic space based on 32 different animal species encoded as feature vectors. The neural network successfully learns the similarities between different animal species, and constructs a cognitive map of 'animal space' based on the principle of successor representations with an accuracy of around 30% which is near to the theoretical maximum regarding the fact that all animal species have more than one possible successor, i.e. nearest neighbor in feature space. Furthermore, a hierarchical structure, i.e. different scales of cognitive maps, can be modeled based on multi-scale successor representations. We find that, in fine-grained cognitive maps, the animal vectors are evenly distributed in feature space. In contrast, in coarse-grained maps, animal vectors are highly clustered according to their biological class, i.e. amphibians, mammals and insects. This could be a possible mechanism explaining the emergence of new abstract semantic concepts. Finally, even completely new or incomplete input can be represented by interpolation of the representations from the cognitive map with remarkable high accuracy of up to 95%. We conclude that the successor representation can serve as a weighted pointer to past memories and experiences, and may therefore be a crucial building block for future machine learning to include prior knowledge, and to derive context knowledge from novel input.","No"
"SUMBot: Summarizing Context in Open-Domain Dialogue Systems","Rui Ribeiro, Lu\'isa Coheur",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06496","In this paper, we investigate the problem of including relevant information as context in open-domain dialogue systems. Most models struggle to identify and incorporate important knowledge from dialogues and simply use the entire turns as context, which increases the size of the input fed to the model with unnecessary information. Additionally, due to the input size limitation of a few hundred tokens of large pre-trained models, regions of the history are not included and informative parts from the dialogue may be omitted. In order to surpass this problem, we introduce a simple method that substitutes part of the context with a summary instead of the whole history, which increases the ability of models to keep track of all the previous relevant information. We show that the inclusion of a summary may improve the answer generation task and discuss some examples to further understand the system's weaknesses.","No"
"Subword Segmental Language Modelling for Nguni Languages","Francois Meyer and Jan Buys",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06525","Subwords have become the standard units of text in NLP, enabling efficient open-vocabulary models. With algorithms like byte-pair encoding (BPE), subword segmentation is viewed as a preprocessing step applied to the corpus before training. This can lead to sub-optimal segmentations for low-resource languages with complex morphologies. We propose a subword segmental language model (SSLM) that learns how to segment words while being trained for autoregressive language modelling. By unifying subword segmentation and language modelling, our model learns subwords that optimise LM performance. We train our model on the 4 Nguni languages of South Africa. These are low-resource agglutinative languages, so subword information is critical. As an LM, SSLM outperforms existing approaches such as BPE-based models on average across the 4 languages. Furthermore, it outperforms standard subword segmenters on unsupervised morphological segmentation. We also train our model as a word-level sequence model, resulting in an unsupervised morphological segmenter that outperforms existing methods by a large margin for all 4 languages. Our results show that learning subword segmentation is an effective alternative to existing subword segmenters, enabling the model to discover morpheme-like subwords that improve its LM capabilities.","No"

We trained a Bidirectional Encoder Decoder from Transformers (BERT) model using a diverse, deidentified corpus of 75 million deidentified clinical notes authored at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).

Our model performs at par with the best publicly available biomedical language models of comparable sizes on the public benchmark tasks, and is significantly better than these models in a within-system evaluation on the two tasks using UCSF data. The use of in-domain vocabulary appears to improve the encoding of longer documents. The use of large clinical corpora appears to enhance document encoding and inferential accuracy.

We address this issue by introducing categorization to the source contextualized representations. The main idea is to enhance generalization by reducing sparsity and overfitting, which is achieved by finding prototypes of token representations over the training set and integrating their embeddings into the source encoding.

Specifically, we propose a cross-modal contrastive learning method to learn a shared space for all languages, where both a coarse-grained sentence-level objective and a fine-grained token-level one are introduced. Experimental results and further analysis show that our method can effectively learn the cross-modal and cross-lingual alignment with a small amount of image-text pairs and achieves significant improvements over the text-only baseline under both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.","No"
"LIME: Weakly-Supervised Text Classification Without Seeds","Seongmin Park, Jihwa Lee",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06720","In weakly-supervised text classification, only label names act as sources of supervision. Predominant approaches to weakly-supervised text classification utilize a two-phase framework, where test samples are first assigned pseudo-labels and are then used to train a neural text classifier. In most previous work, the pseudo-labeling step is dependent on obtaining seed words that best capture the relevance of each class label. We present LIME, a framework for weakly-supervised text classification that entirely replaces the brittle seed-word generation process with entailment-based pseudo-classification. We find that combining weakly-supervised classification and textual entailment mitigates shortcomings of both, resulting in a more streamlined and effective classification pipeline. With just an off-the-shelf textual entailment model, LIME outperforms recent baselines in weakly-supervised text classification and achieves state-of-the-art in 4 benchmarks. We open source our code at https://github.com/seongminp/LIME.","No"
"Assessing Out-of-Domain Language Model Performance from Few Examples","Prasann Singhal, Jarad Forristal, Xi Ye, Greg Durrett",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06725","While pretrained language models have exhibited impressive generalization capabilities, they still behave unpredictably under certain domain shifts. In particular, a model may learn a reasoning process on in-domain training data that does not hold for out-of-domain test data. We address the task of predicting out-of-domain (OOD) performance in a few-shot fashion: given a few target-domain examples and a set of models with similar training performance, can we understand how these models will perform on OOD test data? We benchmark the performance on this task when looking at model accuracy on the few-shot examples, then investigate how to incorporate analysis of the models' behavior using feature attributions to better tackle this problem. Specifically, we explore a set of 'factors' designed to reveal model agreement with certain pathological heuristics that may indicate worse generalization capabilities. On textual entailment, paraphrase recognition, and a synthetic classification task, we show that attribution-based factors can help rank relative model OOD performance. However, accuracy on a few-shot test set is a surprisingly strong baseline, particularly when the system designer does not have in-depth prior knowledge about the domain shift.","No"

We systematically explore three explanation generation approaches from LLM and utilize a multi-task learning framework to facilitate small models to acquire strong reasoning power together with explanation generation capabilities. Experiments on multiple reasoning tasks show that our method can consistently and significantly outperform finetuning baselines across different settings, and even perform better than finetuning/prompting a 60x larger GPT-3 (175B) model by up to 9.5% in accuracy. As a side benefit, human evaluation further shows that our method can generate high-quality explanations to justify its predictions, moving towards the goal of explainable AI.","No"
"Shortcomings of Question Answering Based Factuality Frameworks for Error Localization","Ryo Kamoi, Tanya Goyal, Greg Durrett",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06748","Despite recent progress in abstractive summarization, models often generate summaries with factual errors. Numerous approaches to detect these errors have been proposed, the most popular of which are question answering (QA)-based factuality metrics. These have been shown to work well at predicting summary-level factuality and have potential to localize errors within summaries, but this latter capability has not been systematically evaluated in past research. In this paper, we conduct the first such analysis and find that, contrary to our expectations, QA-based frameworks fail to correctly identify error spans in generated summaries and are outperformed by trivial exact match baselines. Our analysis reveals a major reason for such poor localization: questions generated by the QG module often inherit errors from non-factual summaries which are then propagated further into downstream modules. Moreover, even human-in-the-loop question generation cannot easily offset these problems. Our experiments conclusively show that there exist fundamental issues with localization using the QA framework which cannot be fixed solely by stronger QA and QG models.","No"

We employ a teacher-student framework and propose a novel approach called alternating teaching to mitigate unintended memorization in sequential modeling. In our method, multiple teachers are trained on disjoint training sets whose privacy one wishes to protect, and teachers' predictions supervise the training of a student model in an alternating manner at each time step. Experiments on LibriSpeech datasets show that the proposed method achieves superior privacy-preserving results than other counterparts. In comparison with no prevention for unintended memorization, the overall utility loss is small when training records are sufficient.","No"

We then revise by (c) reranking different continuations for plot coherence and premise relevance, and finally (d) editing the best continuation for factual consistency.

Recent studies on open-book QG, where supportive question-context pairs are provided to models, have achieved promising progress. However, generating natural questions under a more practical closed-book setting that lacks these supporting documents still remains a challenge. In this work, to learn better representations from semantic information hidden in question-answer pairs under the closed-book setting, we propose a new QG model empowered by a contrastive learning module and an answer reconstruction module. We present a new closed-book QA dataset -- WikiCQA involving abstractive long answers collected from a wiki-style website. In the experiments, we validate the proposed QG model on both public datasets and the new WikiCQA dataset. Empirical results show that the proposed QG model outperforms baselines in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. In addition, we show how to leverage the proposed model to improve existing closed-book QA systems. We observe that by pre-training a closed-book QA model on our generated synthetic QA pairs, significant QA improvement can be achieved on both seen and unseen datasets, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of our QG model for enhancing unsupervised and semi-supervised QA.","No"
"SDW-ASL: A Dynamic System to Generate Large Scale Dataset for Continuous American Sign Language","Yehong Jiang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06791","Despite tremendous progress in natural language processing using deep learning techniques in recent years, sign language production and comprehension has advanced very little. One critical barrier is the lack of largescale datasets available to the public due to the unbearable cost of labeled data generation. Efforts to provide public data for American Sign Language (ASL) comprehension have yielded two datasets, comprising more than thousand video clips. These datasets are large enough to enable a meaningful start to deep learning research on sign languages but are far too small to lead to any solution that can be practically deployed. So far, there is still no suitable dataset for ASL production. We proposed a system that can generate large scale ASL datasets for continuous ASL. It is suitable for general ASL processing and is particularly useful for ASL production. The continuous ASL dataset contains English labeled human articulations in condensed body pose data formats. To better serve the research community, we are releasing the first version of our ASL dataset, which contains 30k sentences, 416k words, a vocabulary of 18k words, in a total of 104 hours. This is the largest continuous sign language dataset published to date in terms of video duration. We also describe a system that can evolve and expand the dataset to incorporate better data processing techniques and more contents when available. It is our hope that the release of this ASL dataset and the sustainable dataset generation system to the public will propel better deep-learning research in ASL natural language processing.","No"
"Benchmarking Long-tail Generalization with Likelihood Splits","Ameya Godbole, Robin Jia",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06799","In order to reliably process natural language, NLP systems must generalize to the long tail of rare utterances. We propose a method to create challenging benchmarks that require generalizing to the tail of the distribution by re-splitting existing datasets. We create 'Likelihood splits' where examples that are assigned lower likelihood by a pre-trained language model (LM) are placed in the test set, and more likely examples are in the training set. This simple approach can be customized to construct meaningful train-test splits for a wide range of tasks. Likelihood splits are more challenging than random splits: relative error rates of state-of-the-art models on our splits increase by 59% for semantic parsing on Spider, 77% for natural language inference on SNLI, and 38% for yes/no question answering on BoolQ compared with the corresponding random splits. Moreover, Likelihood splits create fairer benchmarks than adversarial filtering; when the LM used to create the splits is used as the task model, our splits do not adversely penalize the LM.","No"

In this paper, we investigate whether language learners can contribute annotations to the benchmark datasets. In a carefully controlled annotation experiment, we recruit 36 language learners, provide two types of additional resources (dictionaries and machine-translated sentences), and perform mini-tests to measure their language proficiency. We target three languages, English, Korean, and Indonesian, and four NLP tasks, sentiment analysis, natural language inference, named entity recognition, and machine reading comprehension. We find that language learners, especially those with intermediate or advanced language proficiency, are able to provide fairly accurate labels with the help of additional resources. Moreover, we show that data annotation improves learners' language proficiency in terms of vocabulary and grammar. The implication of our findings is that broadening the annotation task to include language learners can open up the opportunity to build benchmark datasets for languages for which it is difficult to recruit native speakers.","No"

"Algorithms for Weighted Pushdown Automata","Alexandra Butoi, Brian DuSell, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell, David Chiang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06884","Weighted pushdown automata (WPDAs) are at the core of many natural language processing tasks, like syntax-based statistical machine translation and transition-based dependency parsing.

In this paper, we develop novel algorithms that operate directly on WPDAs. Our algorithms are inspired by Lang's algorithm, but use a more general definition of pushdown automaton and either reduce the space requirements by a factor of $|\Gamma|$ (the size of the stack alphabet) or reduce the runtime by a factor of more than $|Q|$ (the number of states). When run on the same class of PDAs as Lang's algorithm, our algorithm is both more space-efficient by a factor of $|\Gamma|$ and more time-efficient by a factor of $|Q| \cdot |\Gamma|$.","No"
"On the Evaluation of the Plausibility and Faithfulness of Sentiment Analysis Explanations","Julia El Zini, Mohamad Mansour, Basel Mousi, and Mariette Awad",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06916","Current Explainable AI (ExAI) methods, especially in the NLP field, are conducted on various datasets by employing different metrics to evaluate several aspects. The lack of a common evaluation framework is hindering the progress tracking of such methods and their wider adoption. In this work, inspired by offline information retrieval, we propose different metrics and techniques to evaluate the explainability of SA models from two angles. First, we evaluate the strength of the extracted 'rationales' in faithfully explaining the predicted outcome. Second, we measure the agreement between ExAI methods and human judgment on a homegrown dataset1 to reflect on the rationales plausibility. Our conducted experiments comprise four dimensions: (1) the underlying architectures of SA models, (2) the approach followed by the ExAI method, (3) the reasoning difficulty, and (4) the homogeneity of the ground-truth rationales. We empirically demonstrate that anchors explanations are more aligned with the human judgment and can be more confident in extracting supporting rationales. As can be foreseen, the reasoning complexity of sentiment is shown to thwart ExAI methods from extracting supporting evidence. Moreover, a remarkable discrepancy is discerned between the results of different explainability methods on the various architectures suggesting the need for consolidation to observe enhanced performance. Predominantly, transformers are shown to exhibit better explainability than convolutional and recurrent architectures. Our work paves the way towards designing more interpretable NLP models and enabling a common evaluation ground for their relative strengths and robustness.","No"

"On the Explainability of Natural Language Processing Deep Models","Julia El Zini and Mariette Awad",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06929","While there has been a recent explosion of work on ExplainableAI ExAI on deep models that operate on imagery and tabular data, textual datasets present new challenges to the ExAI community. Such challenges can be attributed to the lack of input structure in textual data, the use of word embeddings that add to the opacity of the models and the difficulty of the visualization of the inner workings of deep models when they are trained on textual data. Lately, methods have been developed to address the aforementioned challenges and present satisfactory explanations on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. However, such methods are yet to be studied in a comprehensive framework where common challenges are properly stated and rigorous evaluation practices and metrics are proposed. Motivated to democratize ExAI methods in the NLP field, we present in this work a survey that studies model-agnostic as well as model-specific explainability methods on NLP models. Such methods can either develop inherently interpretable NLP models or operate on pre-trained models in a post-hoc manner. We make this distinction and we further decompose the methods into three categories according to what they explain: (1) word embeddings (input-level), (2) inner workings of NLP models (processing-level) and (3) models' decisions (output-level). We also detail the different evaluation approaches interpretability methods in the NLP field.

Given the fact that for humans the question of whether a text is biased can be difficult to answer or is answered contradictory, we ask whether an 'absolute bias classification' is a promising goal at all. We see the problem not in the complexity of interpreting language phenomena but in the diversity of sociocultural backgrounds of the readers, which cannot be handled uniformly: To decide whether a text has crossed the proverbial line between non-biased and biased is subjective. By asking 'Is text X more [less, equally] biased than text Y?' we propose to analyze a simpler problem, which, by its construction, is rather independent of standpoints, views, or sociocultural aspects. In such a model, bias becomes a preference relation that induces a partial ordering from least biased to most biased texts without requiring a decision on where to draw the line. A prerequisite for this kind of bias model is the ability of humans to perceive relative bias differences in the first place. In our research, we selected a specific type of bias in argumentation, the stance bias, and designed a crowdsourcing study showing that differences in stance bias are perceptible when (light) support is provided through training or visual aid.","No"

In this paper, we study the effectiveness of different segmentation approaches on MT performance, covering morphology-based and frequency-based segmentation techniques. We experiment on MT from code-switched Arabic-English to English. We provide detailed analysis, examining a variety of conditions, such as data size and sentences with different degrees in CS. Empirical results show that morphology-aware segmenters perform the best in segmentation tasks but under-perform in MT. Nevertheless, we find that the choice of the segmentation setup to use for MT is highly dependent on the data size. For extreme low-resource scenarios, a combination of frequency and morphology-based segmentations is shown to perform the best. For more resourced settings, such a combination does not bring significant improvements over the use of frequency-based segmentation.","No"

It is desirable that such NMT systems be lexically constrained and draw from domain-specific dictionaries. Dictionaries could present multiple candidate translations for a source words/phrases on account of the polysemous nature of words. The onus is then on the NMT model to choose the contextually most appropriate candidate. Prior work has largely ignored this problem and focused on the single candidate setting where the target word or phrase is replaced by a single constraint. In this work we present DICTDIS, a lexically constrained NMT system that disambiguates between multiple candidate translations derived from dictionaries. We achieve this by augmenting training data with multiple dictionary candidates to actively encourage disambiguation during training. We demonstrate the utility of DICTDIS via extensive experiments on English-Hindi sentences in a variety of domains including news, finance, medicine and engineering. We obtain superior disambiguation performance on all domains with improved fluency in some domains of up to 4 BLEU points, when compared with existing approaches for lexically constrained and unconstrained NMT.","No"

To address these problems, we propose a Cross-lingual Entity Projection framework (CROP) to enable zero-shot cross-lingual NER with the help of a multilingual labeled sequence translation model. Specifically, the target sequence is first translated into the source language and then tagged by a source NER model. We further adopt a labeled sequence translation model to project the tagged sequence back to the target language and label the target raw sentence. Ultimately, the whole pipeline is integrated into an end-to-end model by the way of self-training.

But these methods still performed poorly on fine-grained IDRR and even utterly misidentified on most of the few-shot discourse relation classes. To address these problems, we propose a novel Prompt-based Connective Prediction (PCP) method for IDRR.

We study this problem with a simple two-tower language model setting, where two language models with identical configurations are trained side-by-side cooperatively. With this setting, we discover the spontaneous emerging preference phenomenon, where some of the tokens are consistently better predicted by one tower while others by another tower. This phenomenon is qualitatively stable, regardless of model configuration and type, suggesting this as an intrinsic property of natural language. This study suggests that interesting properties of natural language are still waiting to be discovered, which may aid the future development of natural language processing techniques.","No"

In this paper, to overcome the limitation, we propose a Prompt based domain text Generation (PGEN) approach to produce the large-scale in-domain spoken language text data. Specifically, PGEN randomly concatenates sentences from the original in-domain spoken language text data as prompts to induce a pre-trained language model (i.e., GPT-2) to generate spoken language texts in a similar style. Experimental results on three benchmarks of sign language gloss translation in varied languages demonstrate that BT with spoken language texts generated by PGEN significantly outperforms the compared methods. In addition, as the scale of spoken language texts generated by PGEN increases, the BT technique can achieve further improvements, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We release the code and data for facilitating future research in this field.","No"
"An Open-World Lottery Ticket for Out-of-Domain Intent Classification","Yunhua Zhou, Peiju Liu, Yuxin Wang, Xipeng Qiu",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07071","Most existing methods of Out-of-Domain (OOD) intent classification, which rely on extensive auxiliary OOD corpora or specific training paradigms, are underdeveloped in the underlying principle that the models should have differentiated confidence in In- and Out-of-domain intent. In this work, we demonstrate that calibrated subnetworks can be uncovered by pruning the (poor-calibrated) overparameterized model. Calibrated confidence provided by the subnetwork can better distinguish In- and Out-of-domain. Furthermore, we theoretically bring new insights into why temperature scaling can differentiate In- and Out-of-Domain intent and empirically extend the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis to the open-world setting. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate our approach can establish consistent improvements compared with a suite of competitive baselines.","No"
"CLASP: Few-Shot Cross-Lingual Data Augmentation for Semantic Parsing","Andy Rosenbaum, Saleh Soltan, Wael Hamza, Amir Saffari, Macro Damonte, Isabel Groves",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07074","A bottleneck to developing Semantic Parsing (SP) models is the need for a large volume of human-labeled training data. Given the complexity and cost of human annotation for SP, labeled data is often scarce, particularly in multilingual settings. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at SP given only a few examples, however LLMs are unsuitable for runtime systems which require low latency. In this work, we propose CLASP, a simple method to improve low-resource SP for moderate-sized models: we generate synthetic data from AlexaTM 20B to augment the training set for a model 40x smaller (500M parameters). We evaluate on two datasets in low-resource settings: English PIZZA, containing either 348 or 16 real examples, and mTOP cross-lingual zero-shot, where training data is available only in English, and the model must generalize to four new languages. On both datasets, we show significant improvements over strong baseline methods.","No"
"Query Expansion Using Contextual Clue Sampling with Language Models","Linqing Liu, Minghan Li, Jimmy Lin, Sebastian Riedel, Pontus Stenetorp",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07093","Query expansion is an effective approach for mitigating vocabulary mismatch between queries and documents in information retrieval. One recent line of research uses language models to generate query-related contexts for expansion. Along this line, we argue that expansion terms from these contexts should balance two key aspects: diversity and relevance. The obvious way to increase diversity is to sample multiple contexts from the language model. However, this comes at the cost of relevance, because there is a well-known tendency of models to hallucinate incorrect or irrelevant contexts. To balance these two considerations, we propose a combination of an effective filtering strategy and fusion of the retrieved documents based on the generation probability of each context. Our lexical matching based approach achieves a similar top-5/top-20 retrieval accuracy and higher top-100 accuracy compared with the well-established dense retrieval model DPR, while reducing the index size by more than 96%. For end-to-end QA, the reader model also benefits from our method and achieves the highest Exact-Match score against several competitive baselines.","No"

We show that SaGe does a better job than current widespread tokenizers in keeping token contexts cohesive, while not incurring a large price in terms of encoding efficiency or domain robustness. SaGe improves performance on English GLUE classification tasks as well as on NER, and on Inference and NER in Turkish, demonstrating its robustness to language properties such as morphological exponence and agglutination.","No"

In this paper, we frame D&D specifically as a dialogue system challenge, where the tasks are to both generate the next conversational turn in the game and predict the state of the game given the dialogue history. We create a gameplay dataset consisting of nearly 900 games, with a total of 7,000 players, 800,000 dialogue turns, 500,000 dice rolls, and 58 million words. We automatically annotate the data with partial state information about the game play. We train a large language model (LM) to generate the next game turn, conditioning it on different information. The LM can respond as a particular character or as the player who runs the game--i.e., the Dungeon Master (DM). It is trained to produce dialogue that is either in-character (roleplaying in the fictional world) or out-of-character (discussing rules or strategy). We perform a human evaluation to determine what factors make the generated output plausible and interesting. We further perform an automatic evaluation to determine how well the model can predict the game state given the history and examine how well tracking the game state improves its ability to produce plausible conversational output.","No"
"A Multi-dimensional Evaluation of Tokenizer-free Multilingual Pretrained Models","Jimin Sun, Patrick Fernandes, Xinyi Wang, Graham Neubig",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07111","Recent work on tokenizer-free multilingual pretrained models show promising results in improving cross-lingual transfer and reducing engineering overhead (Clark et al., 2022; Xue et al., 2022). However, these works mainly focus on reporting accuracy on a limited set of tasks and data settings, placing less emphasis on other important factors when tuning and deploying the models in practice, such as memory usage, inference speed, and fine-tuning data robustness. We attempt to fill this gap by performing a comprehensive empirical comparison of multilingual tokenizer-free and subword-based models considering these various dimensions. Surprisingly, we find that subword-based models might still be the most practical choice in many settings, achieving better performance for lower inference latency and memory usage. Based on these results, we encourage future work in tokenizer-free methods to consider these factors when designing and evaluating new models.","No"

However, it is still unclear how the quality of explanations can be assessed effectively. The predominant approach is to compare proxy scores (such as BLEU or explanation F1) evaluated against gold explanations in the dataset. The assumption is that an increase of the proxy score implies a higher utility of explanations to users. In this paper, we question this assumption. In particular, we (i) formulate desired characteristics of explanation quality that apply across tasks and domains, (ii) point out how current evaluation practices violate those characteristics, and (iii) propose actionable guidelines to overcome obstacles that limit today's evaluation of explanation quality and to enable the development of explainable systems that provide tangible benefits for human users. We substantiate our theoretical claims (i.e., the lack of validity and temporal decline of currently-used proxy scores) with empirical evidence from a crowdsourcing case study in which we investigate the explanation quality of state-of-the-art explainable question answering systems.","No"

To employ large language models (LMs) for this task, existing approaches ``serialize'' the output graph as a flat list of nodes and edges. Although feasible, these serialized graphs strongly deviate from the natural language corpora that LMs were pre-trained on, hindering LMs from generating them correctly. In this paper, we show that when we instead frame structured commonsense reasoning tasks as code generation tasks, pre-trained LMs of code are better structured commonsense reasoners than LMs of natural language, even when the downstream task does not involve source code at all. We demonstrate our approach across three diverse structured commonsense reasoning tasks. In all these natural language tasks, we show that using our approach, a code generation LM (CODEX) outperforms natural-LMs that are fine-tuned on the target task (e.g., T5) and other strong LMs such as GPT-3 in the few-shot setting.","No"

However, existing datasets vary in their definition of coreferences and have been collected via complex and lengthy guidelines that are curated for linguistic experts.

In this work, we develop a crowdsourcing-friendly coreference annotation methodology, ezCoref, consisting of an annotation tool and an interactive tutorial. We use ezCoref to re-annotate 240 passages from seven existing English coreference datasets (spanning fiction, news, and multiple other domains) while teaching annotators only cases that are treated similarly across these datasets. Surprisingly, we find that reasonable quality annotations were already achievable (>90% agreement between the crowd and expert annotations) even without extensive training.

Subsampling while training self-supervised models not only improves the overall performance on downstream tasks under certain frame rates, but also brings significant speed-up in inference. Variable-length subsampling performs particularly well under low frame rates. In addition, if we have access to phonetic boundaries, we find no degradation in performance for an average frame rate as low as 10 Hz.","No"

However, automatic evaluation in NLG is still dominated by similarity-based metrics, and we lack a reliable framework for a more comprehensive evaluation of advanced models. In this paper, we propose a unified multi-dimensional evaluator UniEval for NLG. We re-frame NLG evaluation as a Boolean Question Answering (QA) task, and by guiding the model with different questions, we can use one evaluator to evaluate from multiple dimensions. Furthermore, thanks to the unified Boolean QA format, we are able to introduce an intermediate learning phase that enables UniEval to incorporate external knowledge from multiple related tasks and gain further improvement. Experiments on three typical NLG tasks show that UniEval correlates substantially better with human judgments than existing metrics. Specifically, compared to the top-performing unified evaluators, UniEval achieves a 23% higher correlation on text summarization, and over 43% on dialogue response generation. Also, UniEval demonstrates a strong zero-shot learning ability for unseen evaluation dimensions and tasks.

"Towards Trustworthy Automatic Diagnosis Systems by Emulating Doctors' Reasoning with Deep Reinforcement Learning","Arsene Fansi Tchango, Rishab Goel, Julien Martel, Zhi Wen, Gaetan Marceau Caron, Joumana Ghosn",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07198","The automation of the medical evidence acquisition and diagnosis process has recently attracted increasing attention in order to reduce the workload of doctors and democratize access to medical care. However, most works proposed in the machine learning literature focus solely on improving the prediction accuracy of a patient's pathology. We argue that this objective is insufficient to ensure doctors' acceptability of such systems. In their initial interaction with patients, doctors do not only focus on identifying the pathology a patient is suffering from; they instead generate a differential diagnosis (in the form of a short list of plausible diseases) because the medical evidence collected from patients is often insufficient to establish a final diagnosis. Moreover, doctors explicitly explore severe pathologies before potentially ruling them out from the differential, especially in acute care settings. Finally, for doctors to trust a system's recommendations, they need to understand how the gathered evidences led to the predicted diseases. In particular, interactions between a system and a patient need to emulate the reasoning of doctors. We therefore propose to model the evidence acquisition and automatic diagnosis tasks using a deep reinforcement learning framework that considers three essential aspects of a doctor's reasoning, namely generating a differential diagnosis using an exploration-confirmation approach while prioritizing severe pathologies. We propose metrics for evaluating interaction quality based on these three aspects. We show that our approach performs better than existing models while maintaining competitive pathology prediction accuracy.","No"

The criterion can vary from checking that a query executes without errors to verifying the query on a set of tests. In this setting, we augment neural autoregressive models with a search algorithm that looks for a query satisfying the criterion.

While they excel in being faithful to the explained model, saliency maps in their entirety are difficult to interpret for humans, especially for instances with many input features. In contrast, natural language explanations (NLEs) are flexible and can be tuned to a recipient's expectations, but are costly to generate: Rationalization models are usually trained on specific tasks and require high-quality and diverse datasets of human annotations. We combine the advantages from both explainability methods by verbalizing saliency maps. We formalize this underexplored task and propose a novel methodology that addresses two key challenges of this approach -- what and how to verbalize. Our approach utilizes efficient search methods that are task- and model-agnostic and do not require another black-box model, and hand-crafted templates to preserve faithfulness. We conduct a human evaluation of explanation representations across two natural language processing (NLP) tasks: news topic classification and sentiment analysis. Our results suggest that saliency map verbalization makes explanations more understandable and less cognitively challenging to humans than conventional heatmap visualization.","No"

We argue that this taxonomy allows a broader view of the decoding problem and can lead to generalizable statements because it is grounded on the interplay between the decoding algorithms and the likelihood-utility misalignment. Specifically, by analyzing the correlation between the likelihood and the utility of predictions across a diverse set of tasks, we provide the first empirical evidence supporting the proposed taxonomy, and a set of principles to structure reasoning when choosing a decoding algorithm.

Recent contributions relying on deep learning methods focused on agents communicating via an idealized communication channel, where utterances produced by a speaker are directly perceived by a listener. This comes in contrast with human communication, which instead relies on a sensory-motor channel, where motor commands produced by the speaker (e.g. vocal or gestural articulators) result in sensory effects perceived by the listener (e.g. audio or visual). Here, we investigate if agents can evolve a shared language when they are equipped with a continuous sensory-motor system to produce and perceive signs, e.g. drawings. To this end, we introduce the Graphical Referential Game (GREG) where a speaker must produce a graphical utterance to name a visual referent object consisting of combinations of MNIST digits while a listener has to select the corresponding object among distractor referents, given the produced message. The utterances are drawing images produced using dynamical motor primitives combined with a sketching library. To tackle GREG we present CURVES: a multimodal contrastive deep learning mechanism that represents the energy (alignment) between named referents and utterances generated through gradient ascent on the learned energy landscape.

Current approaches cast the problem in a meta-learning framework, where the model needs to be first jointly trained over many training few-shot tasks, each being defined by its own relation, so that learning/prediction on the target few-shot task can be effective. However, in real-world KGs, curating many training tasks is a challenging ad hoc process. Here we propose Connection Subgraph Reasoner (CSR), which can make predictions for the target few-shot task directly without the need for pre-training on the human curated set of training tasks. The key to CSR is that we explicitly model a shared connection subgraph between support and query triplets, as inspired by the principle of eliminative induction. To adapt to specific KG, we design a corresponding self-supervised pretraining scheme with the objective of reconstructing automatically sampled connection subgraphs. Our pretrained model can then be directly applied to target few-shot tasks on without the need for training few-shot tasks. Extensive experiments on real KGs, including NELL, FB15K-237, and ConceptNet, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework: we show that even a learning-free implementation of CSR can already perform competitively to existing methods on target few-shot tasks; with pretraining, CSR can achieve significant gains of up to 52% on the more challenging inductive few-shot tasks where the entities are also unseen during (pre)training.","No"
"Why self-attention is Natural for Sequence-to-Sequence Problems? A Perspective from Symmetries","Chao Ma, Lexing Ying",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06741","In this paper, we show that structures similar to self-attention are natural to learn many sequence-to-sequence problems from the perspective of symmetry. Inspired by language processing applications, we study the orthogonal equivariance of seq2seq functions with knowledge, which are functions taking two inputs -- an input sequence and a ``knowledge'' -- and outputting another sequence. The knowledge consists of a set of vectors in the same embedding space as the input sequence, containing the information of the language used to process the input sequence. We show that orthogonal equivariance in the embedding space is natural for seq2seq functions with knowledge, and under such equivariance the function must take the form close to the self-attention. This shows that network structures similar to self-attention are the right structures to represent the target function of many seq2seq problems. The representation can be further refined if a ``finite information principle'' is considered, or a permutation equivariance holds for the elements of the input sequence.","No"

"Counterfactual Multihop QA: A Cause-Effect Approach for Reducing Disconnected Reasoning","Wangzhen Guo, Qinkang Gong, Hanjiang Lai",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07138","Multi-hop QA requires reasoning over multiple supporting facts to answer the question. However, the existing QA models always rely on shortcuts, e.g., providing the true answer by only one fact, rather than multi-hop reasoning, which is referred as $\textit{disconnected reasoning}$ problem. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel counterfactual multihop QA, a causal-effect approach that enables to reduce the disconnected reasoning. It builds upon explicitly modeling of causality: 1) the direct causal effects of disconnected reasoning and 2) the causal effect of true multi-hop reasoning from the total causal effect. With the causal graph, a counterfactual inference is proposed to disentangle the disconnected reasoning from the total causal effect, which provides us a new perspective and technology to learn a QA model that exploits the true multi-hop reasoning instead of shortcuts. Extensive experiments have conducted on the benchmark HotpotQA dataset, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve notable improvement on reducing disconnected reasoning. For example, our method achieves 5.8% higher points of its Supp$_s$ score on HotpotQA through true multihop reasoning. The code is available at supplementary material.","No"
"SQuAT: Sharpness- and Quantization-Aware Training for BERT","Zheng Wang, Juncheng B Li, Shuhui Qu, Florian Metze, Emma Strubell",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07171","Quantization is an effective technique to reduce memory footprint, inference latency, and power consumption of deep learning models. However, existing quantization methods suffer from accuracy degradation compared to full-precision (FP) models due to the errors introduced by coarse gradient estimation through non-differentiable quantization layers. The existence of sharp local minima in the loss landscapes of overparameterized models (e.g., Transformers) tends to aggravate such performance penalty in low-bit (2, 4 bits) settings. In this work, we propose sharpness- and quantization-aware training (SQuAT), which would encourage the model to converge to flatter minima while performing quantization-aware training. Our proposed method alternates training between sharpness objective and step-size objective, which could potentially let the model learn the most suitable parameter update magnitude to reach convergence near-flat minima. Extensive experiments show that our method can consistently outperform state-of-the-art quantized BERT models under 2, 3, and 4-bit settings on GLUE benchmarks by 1%, and can sometimes even outperform full precision (32-bit) models. Our experiments on empirical measurement of sharpness also suggest that our method would lead to flatter minima compared to other quantization methods.","No"

We propose MAPL, a simple and parameter-efficient method that reuses frozen pre-trained unimodal models and leverages their strong generalization capabilities in multimodal vision-language (VL) settings. MAPL learns a lightweight mapping between the representation spaces of unimodal models using aligned image-text data, and can generalize to unseen VL tasks from just a few in-context examples. The small number of trainable parameters makes MAPL effective at low-data and in-domain learning. Moreover, MAPL's modularity enables easy extension to other pre-trained models. Extensive experiments on several visual question answering and image captioning benchmarks show that MAPL achieves superior or competitive performance compared to similar methods while training orders of magnitude fewer parameters. MAPL can be trained in just a few hours using modest computational resources and public datasets. We plan to release the code and pre-trained models.","No"

While existing metrics have mostly focused on measuring the direct association between the rationale and a given label, we argue that an ideal metric should also be able to focus on the new information uniquely provided in the rationale that is otherwise not provided in the input or the label. We investigate this research problem from an information-theoretic perspective using the conditional V-information. More concretely, we propose a metric called REV (Rationale Evaluation with conditional V-information), that can quantify the new information in a rationale supporting a given label beyond the information already available in the input or the label. Experiments on reasoning tasks across four benchmarks, including few-shot prompting with GPT-3, demonstrate the effectiveness of REV in evaluating different types of rationale-label pairs, compared to existing metrics. Through several quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate the capability of REV in providing more sensitive measurements of new information in free-text rationales with respect to a label. Furthermore, REV is consistent with human judgments on rationale evaluations. Overall, when used alongside traditional performance metrics, REV provides deeper insights into a models' reasoning and prediction processes.","No"

We also add tense information into event representations to explicitly place an emphasis on the contextual description. The second perspective is to provide proper uncertainty estimation and abstain from extraction when no relation is described in the text. By parameterization of Dirichlet Prior over the model-predicted categorical distribution, we improve the model estimates of the correctness likelihood and make TempRel predictions more selective.

Owing to the lack of a purpose-built dataset for text-to-video retrieval, video captioning datasets have been re-purposed to evaluate models by (1) treating captions as positive matches to their respective videos and (2) all other videos as negatives. However, this methodology leads to a fundamental flaw during evaluation: since captions are marked as relevant only to their original video, many alternate videos also match the caption, which creates false-negative caption-video pairs. We show that when these false negatives are corrected, a recent state-of-the-art model gains 25% recall points -- a difference that threatens the validity of the benchmark itself. To diagnose and mitigate this issue, we annotate and release 683K additional caption-video pairs. Using these, we recompute effectiveness scores for three models on two standard benchmarks (MSR-VTT and MSVD). We find that (1) the recomputed metrics are up to 25% recall points higher for the best models, (2) these benchmarks are nearing saturation for Recall@10, (3) caption length (generality) is related to the number of positives, and (4) annotation costs can be mitigated by choosing evaluation sizes corresponding to desired effect size to detect.

In this work, we propose Multi-CLS BERT, a novel ensembling method for CLS-based prediction tasks that is almost as efficient as a single BERT model. Multi-CLS BERT uses multiple CLS tokens with a parameterization and objective that encourages their diversity. Thus instead of fine-tuning each BERT model in an ensemble (and running them all at test time), we need only fine-tune our single Multi-CLS BERT model (and run the one model at test time, ensembling just the multiple final CLS embeddings). To test its effectiveness, we build Multi-CLS BERT on top of a state-of-the-art pretraining method for BERT (Aroca-Ouellette and Rudzicz, 2020). In experiments on GLUE and SuperGLUE we show that our Multi-CLS BERT reliably improves both overall accuracy and confidence estimation. When only 100 training samples are available in GLUE, the Multi-CLS BERT_Base model can even outperform the corresponding BERT_Large model. We analyze the behavior of our Multi-CLS BERT, showing that it has many of the same characteristics and behavior as a typical BERT 5-way ensemble, but with nearly 4-times less computation and memory.","No"

We propose a simple method to expose fuzzy-match NMT systems during training and show that it results in a system that is much more tolerant (regaining up to 5.8 BLEU) to inference with TMs with domain mismatch. Also, the model is still competitive to the baseline when fed with suggestions from relevant TMs.","No"

Concretely, we first leverage simple numbers as anchors to probe the implicitly inferred arithmetic expressions from language models, and then explicitly apply the expressions on complex numbers to get corresponding answers. To inversely elicit arithmetic expressions, we transform and formulate the task as an analytically solvable linear system. Experimental results on several numerical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves numerical reasoning capabilities of existing LMs. More importantly, our approach is training-free and simply works in the inference phase, making it highly portable and achieving consistent performance benefits across a variety of language models (GPT-3, T5, BART, etc) in all zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios.","No"

However, it fails to defend its position in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is dominated by Layer Normalization (LN). In this paper, we are trying to answer why BN usually performs worse than LN in NLP tasks with Transformer models. We find that the inconsistency between training and inference of BN is the leading cause that results in the failure of BN in NLP. We define Training Inference Discrepancy (TID) to quantitatively measure this inconsistency and reveal that TID can indicate BN's performance, supported by extensive experiments, including image classification, neural machine translation, language modeling, sequence labeling, and text classification tasks. We find that BN can obtain much better test performance than LN when TID keeps small through training. To suppress the explosion of TID, we propose Regularized BN (RBN) that adds a simple regularization term to narrow the gap between batch statistics and population statistics of BN.

Further, recent studies show that such dense retrievers underperform BM25 in various settings. We thus propose a new architecture, Task-aware Specialization for dense Retrieval (TASER), which enables parameter sharing by interleaving shared and specialized blocks in a single encoder.

While recent research efforts improve the performance of traditional ad-hoc retrieval models, legal case retrieval is still challenging since queries are legal cases, which contain hundreds of tokens. Legal cases are much longer and more complicated than keywords queries. Apart from that, the definition of legal relevance is beyond the general definition. In addition to general topical relevance, the relevant cases also involve similar situations and legal elements, which can support the judgment of the current case. In this paper, we propose an interaction-focused network for legal case retrieval with a multi-view contrastive learning objective. The contrastive learning views, including case-view and element-view, aim to overcome the above challenges. The case-view contrastive learning minimizes the hidden space distance between relevant legal case representations produced by a pre-trained language model (PLM) encoder. The element-view builds positive and negative instances by changing legal elements of cases to help the network better compute legal relevance. To achieve this, we employ a legal element knowledge-aware indicator to detect legal elements of cases. We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark of relevant case retrieval. Evaluation results indicate our proposed method obtains significant improvement over the existing methods.","No"

Second, existing graph-based NR methods are promising but lack effective news-user feature interaction, rendering the graph-based recommendation suboptimal. To overcome these limitations, we propose dual-interactive graph attention networks (DIGAT) consisting of news- and user-graph channels. In the news-graph channel, we enrich the semantics of single candidate news by incorporating the semantically relevant news information with a semantic-augmented graph (SAG).

Most notably, we design a dual-graph interaction process to perform effective feature interaction between the news and user graphs, which facilitates accurate news-user representation matching.

In this work, we argue that CTC does in fact make sense for translation if applied in a joint CTC/attention framework wherein CTC's core properties can counteract several key weaknesses of pure-attention models during training and decoding. To validate this conjecture, we modify the Hybrid CTC/Attention model originally proposed for ASR to support text-to-text translation (MT) and speech-to-text translation (ST). Our proposed joint CTC/attention models outperform pure-attention baselines across six benchmark translation tasks.","No"
"How Well Do Multi-hop Reading Comprehension Models Understand Date Information?","Xanh Ho, Saku Sugawara, and Akiko Aizawa",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05208","Several multi-hop reading comprehension datasets have been proposed to resolve the issue of reasoning shortcuts by which questions can be answered without performing multi-hop reasoning. However, the ability of multi-hop models to perform step-by-step reasoning when finding an answer to a comparison question remains unclear. It is also unclear how questions about the internal reasoning process are useful for training and evaluating question-answering (QA) systems. To evaluate the model precisely in a hierarchical manner, we first propose a dataset, \textit{HieraDate}, with three probing tasks in addition to the main question: extraction, reasoning, and robustness. Our dataset is created by enhancing two previous multi-hop datasets, HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA, focusing on multi-hop questions on date information that involve both comparison and numerical reasoning. We then evaluate the ability of existing models to understand date information. Our experimental results reveal that the multi-hop models do not have the ability to subtract two dates even when they perform well in date comparison and number subtraction tasks. Other results reveal that our probing questions can help to improve the performance of the models (e.g., by +10.3 F1) on the main QA task and our dataset can be used for data augmentation to improve the robustness of the models.","No"
"A Win-win Deal: Towards Sparse and Robust Pre-trained Language Models","Yuanxin Liu, Fandong Meng, Zheng Lin, Jiangnan Li, Peng Fu, Yanan Cao, Weiping Wang, Jie Zhou",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05211","Despite the remarkable success of pre-trained language models (PLMs), they still face two challenges: First, large-scale PLMs are inefficient in terms of memory footprint and computation. Second, on the downstream tasks, PLMs tend to rely on the dataset bias and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In response to the efficiency problem, recent studies show that dense PLMs can be replaced with sparse subnetworks without hurting the performance. Such subnetworks can be found in three scenarios: 1) the fine-tuned PLMs, 2) the raw PLMs and then fine-tuned in isolation, and even inside 3) PLMs without any parameter fine-tuning. However, these results are only obtained in the in-distribution (ID) setting. In this paper, we extend the study on PLMs subnetworks to the OOD setting, investigating whether sparsity and robustness to dataset bias can be achieved simultaneously. To this end, we conduct extensive experiments with the pre-trained BERT model on three natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Our results demonstrate that \textbf{sparse and robust subnetworks (SRNets) can consistently be found in BERT}, across the aforementioned three scenarios, using different training and compression methods. Furthermore, we explore the upper bound of SRNets using the OOD information and show that \textbf{there exist sparse and almost unbiased BERT subnetworks}. Finally, we present 1) an analytical study that provides insights on how to promote the efficiency of SRNets searching process and 2) a solution to improve subnetworks' performance at high sparsity.

"CHAE: Fine-Grained Controllable Story Generation with Characters, Actions and Emotions","Xinpeng Wang, Han Jiang, Zhihua Wei, Shanlin Zhou",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05221","Story generation has emerged as an interesting yet challenging NLP task in recent years. Some existing studies aim at generating fluent and coherent stories from keywords and outlines; while others attempt to control the global features of the story, such as emotion, style and topic. However, these works focus on coarse-grained control on the story, neglecting control on the details of the story, which is also crucial for the task. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a model for fine-grained control on the story, which allows the generation of customized stories with characters, corresponding actions and emotions arbitrarily assigned. Extensive experimental results on both automatic and human manual evaluations show the superiority of our method. It has strong controllability to generate stories according to the fine-grained personalized guidance, unveiling the effectiveness of our methodology.

This paper explores a novel PLM reuse paradigm, Knowledge Integration (KI). Without human annotations available, KI aims to merge the knowledge from different teacher-PLMs, each of which specializes in a different classification problem, into a versatile student model. To achieve this, we first derive the correlation between virtual golden supervision and teacher predictions. We then design a Model Uncertainty--aware Knowledge Integration (MUKI) framework to recover the golden supervision for the student. Specifically, MUKI adopts Monte-Carlo Dropout to estimate model uncertainty for the supervision integration. An instance-wise re-weighting mechanism based on the margin of uncertainty scores is further incorporated, to deal with the potential conflicting supervision from teachers. Experimental results demonstrate that MUKI achieves substantial improvements over baselines on benchmark datasets. Further analysis shows that MUKI can generalize well for merging teacher models with heterogeneous architectures, and even teachers major in cross-lingual datasets.","No"

Rojas-Barahona",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05252","Task-oriented dialogue systems are designed to achieve specific goals while conversing with humans. In practice, they may have to handle simultaneously several domains and tasks.

However, learning with reinforcement in such context becomes difficult because the state-action dimension is larger while the reward signal remains scarce. Our experimental results suggest that structured policies based on graph neural networks combined with different degrees of imitation learning can effectively handle multi-domain dialogues. The reported experiments underline the benefit of structured policies over standard policies.","No"
"Rethinking the Event Coding Pipeline with Prompt Entailment","Cl\'ement Lefebvre, Niklas Stoehr",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05257","For monitoring crises, political events are extracted from the news. The large amount of unstructured full-text event descriptions makes a case-by-case analysis unmanageable, particularly for low-resource humanitarian aid organizations. This creates a demand to classify events into event types, a task referred to as event coding. Typically, domain experts craft an event type ontology, annotators label a large dataset and technical experts develop a supervised coding system. In this work, we propose PR-ENT, a new event coding approach that is more flexible and resource-efficient, while maintaining competitive accuracy: first, we extend an event description such as 'Military injured two civilians'' by a template, e.g. 'People were [Z]' and prompt a pre-trained (cloze) language model to fill the slot Z. Second, we select answer candidates Z* = {'injured'', 'hurt'...} by treating the event description as premise and the filled templates as hypothesis in a textual entailment task. This allows domain experts to draft the codebook directly as labeled prompts and interpretable answer candidates. This human-in-the-loop process is guided by our interactive codebook design tool. We evaluate PR-ENT in several robustness checks: perturbing the event description and prompt template, restricting the vocabulary and removing contextual information.","No"
"Once is Enough: A Light-Weight Cross-Attention for Fast Sentence Pair Modeling","Yuanhang Yang, shiyi qi, Cuiyun Gao, Zenglin Xu, Yulan He, Qifan Wang and Chuanyi Liu",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05261","Transformer-based models have achieved great success on sentence pair modeling tasks, such as answer selection and natural language inference (NLI). These models generally perform cross-attention over input pairs, leading to prohibitive computational costs. Recent studies propose dual-encoder and late interaction architectures for faster computation. However, the balance between the expressive of cross-attention and computation speedup still needs better coordinated. To this end, this paper introduces a novel paradigm MixEncoder for efficient sentence pair modeling. MixEncoder involves a light-weight cross-attention mechanism. It conducts query encoding only once while modeling the query-candidate interaction in parallel. Extensive experiments conducted on four tasks demonstrate that our MixEncoder can speed up sentence pairing by over 113x while achieving comparable performance as the more expensive cross-attention models.","No"

"Towards Structure-aware Paraphrase Identification with Phrase Alignment Using Sentence Encoders","Qiwei Peng, David Weir, Julie Weeds",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05302","Previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of utilising pre-trained sentence encoders based on their sentence representations for meaning comparison tasks. Though such representations are shown to capture hidden syntax structures, the direct similarity comparison between them exhibits weak sensitivity to word order and structural differences in given sentences. A single similarity score further makes the comparison process hard to interpret. Therefore, we here propose to combine sentence encoders with an alignment component by representing each sentence as a list of predicate-argument spans (where their span representations are derived from sentence encoders), and decomposing the sentence-level meaning comparison into the alignment between their spans for paraphrase identification tasks. Empirical results show that the alignment component brings in both improved performance and interpretability for various sentence encoders. After closer investigation, the proposed approach indicates increased sensitivity to structural difference and enhanced ability to distinguish non-paraphrases with high lexical overlap.","No"

We introduce novel methods to parse, factorize, decode, and evaluate SignWriting, leveraging ideas from neural factored MT. In a bilingual setup--translating from American Sign Language to (American) English--our method achieves over 30 BLEU, while in two multilingual setups--translating in both directions between spoken languages and signed languages--we achieve over 20 BLEU. We find that common MT techniques used to improve spoken language translation similarly affect the performance of sign language translation.

Recent work achieves significant results on the WSI task by pre-training a language model that can exclusively disambiguate word senses, whereas others employ previously pre-trained language models in conjunction with additional strategies to induce senses. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised method based on hierarchical clustering and invariant information clustering (IIC). The IIC is used to train a small model to optimize the mutual information between two vector representations of a target word occurring in a pair of synthetic paraphrases. This model is later used in inference mode to extract a higher quality vector representation to be used in the hierarchical clustering. We evaluate our method on two WSI tasks and in two distinct clustering configurations (fixed and dynamic number of clusters). We empirically demonstrate that, in certain cases, our approach outperforms prior WSI state-of-the-art methods, while in others, it achieves a competitive performance.","No"

Several organizations, including the World Health Organization, have developed automated social media analysis tools that classify COVID-19-related tweets into various topics. However, these tools that help combat the pandemic are limited to very few languages, making several countries unable to take their benefit. While multi-lingual or low-resource language-specific tools are being developed, they still need to expand their coverage, such as for the Nepali language. In this paper, we identify the eight most common COVID-19 discussion topics among the Twitter community using the Nepali language, set up an online platform to automatically gather Nepali tweets containing the COVID-19-related keywords, classify the tweets into the eight topics, and visualize the results across the period in a web-based dashboard.

This work investigates the group fairness of multilingual models, asking whether these models are equally fair across languages. To this end, we create a new four-way multilingual dataset of parallel cloze test examples (MozArt), equipped with demographic information (balanced with regard to gender and native tongue) about the test participants.

First, an ennoising process corrupts texts with arbitrary noising functions to construct training instances. Then, a denoising language model is trained to restore the corrupted tokens. Existing studies have made progress by optimizing independent strategies of either ennoising or denosing. They treat training instances equally throughout the training process, with little attention on the individual contribution of those instances. To model explicit signals of instance contribution, this work proposes to estimate the complexity of restoring the original sentences from corrupted ones in language model pre-training. The estimations involve the corruption degree in the ennoising data construction process and the prediction confidence in the denoising counterpart.

"Better Than Whitespace: Information Retrieval for Languages without Custom Tokenizers","Odunayo Ogundepo, Xinyu Zhang, and Jimmy Lin",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05481","Tokenization is a crucial step in information retrieval, especially for lexical matching algorithms, where the quality of indexable tokens directly impacts the effectiveness of a retrieval system. Since different languages have unique properties, the design of the tokenization algorithm is usually language-specific and requires at least some lingustic knowledge. However, only a handful of the 7000+ languages on the planet benefit from specialized, custom-built tokenization algorithms, while the other languages are stuck with a 'default' whitespace tokenizer, which cannot capture the intricacies of different languages. To address this challenge, we propose a different approach to tokenization for lexical matching retrieval algorithms (e.g., BM25): using the WordPiece tokenizer, which can be built automatically from unsupervised data. We test the approach on 11 typologically diverse languages in the MrTyDi collection: results show that the mBERT tokenizer provides strong relevance signals for retrieval 'out of the box', outperforming whitespace tokenization on most languages. In many cases, our approach also improves retrieval effectiveness when combined with existing custom-built tokenizers.","No"

Prior works show that the recently-proposed sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) optimization method can improve the model generalization. However, SAM adds a perturbation to each model parameter equally (but not all parameters contribute equally to the optimization of training), which we argue is sub-optimal and will lead to excessive computation. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization procedure, namely FSAM, which introduces a Fisher mask to improve the efficiency and performance of SAM. In short, instead of adding perturbation to all parameters, FSAM uses the Fisher information to identity the important parameters and formulates a Fisher mask to obtain the sparse perturbation, i.e., making the optimizer focus on these important parameters. Experiments on various tasks in GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks show that FSAM consistently outperforms the vanilla SAM by 0.67~1.98 average score among four different pretrained models. We also empirically show that FSAM works well in other complex scenarios, e.g., fine-tuning on generation tasks or limited training data. Encouragingly, when training data is limited, FSAM improves the SAM by a large margin, i.e., up to 15.1.","No"

In this paper, we focus on evidence-based fake news detection, where several evidences are utilized to probe the veracity of news (i.e., a claim). Most previous methods first employ sequential models to embed the semantic information and then capture the claim-evidence interaction based on attention mechanisms. Despite their effectiveness, they still suffer from three weaknesses. Firstly, sequential models fail to integrate the relevant information that is scattered far apart in evidences. Secondly, they underestimate much redundant information in evidences may be useless or harmful. Thirdly, insufficient data utilization limits the separability and reliability of representations captured by the model. To solve these problems, we propose a unified Graph-based sEmantic structure mining framework with ConTRAstive Learning, namely GETRAL in short. Specifically, we first model claims and evidences as graph-structured data to capture the long-distance semantic dependency. Consequently, we reduce information redundancy by performing graph structure learning. Then the fine-grained semantic representations are fed into the claim-evidence interaction module for predictions. Finally, an adversarial contrastive learning module is applied to make full use of data and strengthen representation learning. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of GETRAL over the state-of-the-arts and validated the efficacy of semantic mining with graph structure and contrastive learning.","No"
"Capturing Global Structural Information in Long Document Question Answering with Compressive Graph Selector Network","Yuxiang Nie, Heyan Huang, Wei Wei, Xian-Ling Mao",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05499","Long document question answering is a challenging task due to its demands for complex reasoning over long text. Previous works usually take long documents as non-structured flat texts or only consider the local structure in long documents. However, these methods usually ignore the global structure of the long document, which is essential for long-range understanding. To tackle this problem, we propose Compressive Graph Selector Network (CGSN) to capture the global structure in a compressive and iterative manner. Specifically, the proposed model consists of three modules: local graph network, global graph network and evidence memory network. Firstly, the local graph network builds the graph structure of the chunked segment in token, sentence, paragraph and segment levels to capture the short-term dependency of the text. Secondly, the global graph network selectively receives the information of each level from the local graph, compresses them into the global graph nodes and applies graph attention into the global graph nodes to build the long-range reasoning over the entire text in an iterative way. Thirdly, the evidence memory network is designed to alleviate the redundancy problem in the evidence selection via saving the selected result in the previous steps. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model outperforms previous methods on two datasets.","No"

Through comprehensive experiments in multiple task settings that differ in the number of models available for cascading (K value), we show that cascading improves both the computational efficiency and the prediction accuracy. For instance, in K=3 setting, cascading saves up to 88.93% computation cost and consistently achieves superior prediction accuracy with an improvement of up to 2.18%. We also study the impact of introducing additional models in the cascade and show that it further increases the efficiency improvements.

There are clear benefits to these approaches compared to the original Transformer in terms of efficiency, but Hierarchical Attention Transformer (HAT) models are a vastly understudied alternative. We develop and release fully pre-trained HAT models that use segment-wise followed by cross-segment encoders and compare them with Longformer models and partially pre-trained HATs. In several long document downstream classification tasks, our best HAT model outperforms equally-sized Longformer models while using 10-20% less GPU memory and processing documents 40-45% faster. In a series of ablation studies, we find that HATs perform best with cross-segment contextualization throughout the model than alternative configurations that implement either early or late cross-segment contextualization.

In this paper, we introduce a new release of a corpus for anaphoric reference labelled via a game-with-a-purpose. This new release is comparable in size to the largest existing corpora for anaphoric reference due in part to substantial activity by the players, in part thanks to the use of a new resolve-and-aggregate paradigm to 'complete' markable annotations through the combination of an anaphoric resolver and an aggregation method for anaphoric reference. The proposed method could be adopted to greatly speed up annotation time in other projects involving games-with-a-purpose. In addition, the corpus covers genres for which no comparable size datasets exist (Fiction and Wikipedia); it covers singletons and non-referring expressions; and it includes a substantial number of long documents (> 2K in length).","No"

Here we show another problem with multilingual models: grammatical structures in higher-resource languages bleed into lower-resource languages, a phenomenon we call grammatical structure bias. We show this bias via a novel method for comparing the fluency of multilingual models to the fluency of monolingual Spanish and Greek models: testing their preference for two carefully-chosen variable grammatical structures (optional pronoun-drop in Spanish and optional Subject-Verb ordering in Greek). We find that multilingual BERT is biased toward the English-like setting (explicit pronouns and Subject-Verb-Object ordering) as compared to our monolingual control. With our case studies, we hope to bring to light the fine-grained ways in which dominant languages can affect and bias multilingual performance, and encourage more linguistically-aware fluency evaluation.","No"
"SEE-Few: Seed, Expand and Entail for Few-shot Named Entity Recognition","Zeng Yang and Linhai Zhang and Deyu Zhou",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05632","Few-shot named entity recognition (NER) aims at identifying named entities based on only few labeled instances. Current few-shot NER methods focus on leveraging existing datasets in the rich-resource domains which might fail in a training-from-scratch setting where no source-domain data is used. To tackle training-from-scratch setting, it is crucial to make full use of the annotation information (the boundaries and entity types). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-task (Seed, Expand and Entail) learning framework, SEE-Few, for Few-shot NER without using source domain data. The seeding and expanding modules are responsible for providing as accurate candidate spans as possible for the entailing module. The entailing module reformulates span classification as a textual entailment task, leveraging both the contextual clues and entity type information. All the three modules share the same text encoder and are jointly learned. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets under the training-from-scratch setting show that the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art few-shot NER methods with a large margin.

"Generating Executable Action Plans with Environmentally-Aware Language Models","Maitrey Gramopadhye, Daniel Szafir",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04964","Large Language Models (LLMs) trained using massive text datasets have recently shown promise in generating action plans for robotic agents from high level text queries. However, these models typically do not consider the robot's environment, resulting in generated plans that may not actually be executable due to ambiguities in the planned actions or environmental constraints. In this paper, we propose an approach to generate environmentally-aware action plans that can be directly mapped to executable agent actions. Our approach involves integrating environmental objects and object relations as additional inputs into LLM action plan generation to provide the system with an awareness of its surroundings, resulting in plans where each generated action is mapped to objects present in the scene. We also design a novel scoring function that, along with generating the action steps and associating them with objects, helps the system disambiguate among object instances and take into account their states. We evaluate our approach using the VirtualHome simulator and the ActivityPrograms knowledge base. Our results show that the action plans generated from our system outperform prior work in terms of their correctness and executability by 5.3% and 8.9% respectively.","No"

We view the diffusion denoising process as a sequential decision making process, and show that it exhibits compounding errors similar to exposure bias issues in imitation learning problems. To mitigate these issues, we adapt the scheduled sampling algorithm to diffusion training. We conduct experiments on four markup datasets: mathematical formulas (LaTeX), table layouts (HTML), sheet music (LilyPond), and molecular images (SMILES). These experiments each verify the effectiveness of the diffusion process and the use of scheduled sampling to fix generation issues. These results also show that the markup-to-image task presents a useful controlled compositional setting for diagnosing and analyzing generative image models.","No"

We observe that, similar to traditional software, redundant computation exists in AdNNs, resulting in considerable performance degradation. The performance degradation is dependent on the input and is referred to as input-dependent performance bottlenecks (IDPBs). To ensure an AdNN satisfies the performance requirements of resource-constrained applications, it is essential to conduct performance testing to detect IDPBs in the AdNN. Existing neural network testing methods are primarily concerned with correctness testing, which does not involve performance testing. To fill this gap, we propose DeepPerform, a scalable approach to generate test samples to detect the IDPBs in AdNNs. We first demonstrate how the problem of generating performance test samples detecting IDPBs can be formulated as an optimization problem. Following that, we demonstrate how DeepPerform efficiently handles the optimization problem by learning and estimating the distribution of AdNNs' computational consumption. We evaluate DeepPerform on three widely used datasets against five popular AdNN models. The results show that DeepPerform generates test samples that cause more severe performance degradation (FLOPs: increase up to 552\%). Furthermore, DeepPerform is substantially more efficient than the baseline methods in generating test inputs(runtime overhead: only 6-10 milliseconds).","No"

This task requires a range of skills - the interaction between vision and language, video retrieval, passage comprehension, and visual answer localization. To solve these, we propose a cross-modal contrastive global-span (CCGS) method for the VCVAL, jointly training the video corpus retrieval and visual answer localization tasks. More precisely, we enhance the video question-answer semantic by adding element-wise visual information into the pre-trained language model, and designing a novel global-span predictor through fusion information to locate the visual answer point. The Global-span contrastive learning is adopted to differentiate the span point in the positive and negative samples with the global-span matrix. We have reconstructed a new dataset named MedVidCQA and benchmarked the VCVAL task, where the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) both in the video corpus retrieval and visual answer localization tasks.

There is minimal theoretical understanding of empirical success, e.g., why fine-tuning a model with $10^8$ or more parameters on a couple dozen training points does not result in overfitting. We investigate whether the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) - which originated as a model to study the gradient descent dynamics of infinitely wide networks with suitable random initialization - describes fine-tuning of pre-trained LMs. This study was inspired by the decent performance of NTK for computer vision tasks (Wei et al., 2022). We also extend the NTK formalism to fine-tuning with Adam. We present extensive experiments that show that once the downstream task is formulated as a language modeling problem through prompting, the NTK lens can often reasonably describe the model updates during fine-tuning with both SGD and Adam. This kernel view also suggests an explanation for success of parameter-efficient subspace-based fine-tuning methods.

Existing transfer and active learning approaches meant to reduce annotation effort require fine-tuning, which suffers from over-fitting to noise and can cause domain shift with small sample sizes.

ATF leverages the internal linguistic knowledge of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to facilitate the transfer of information from existing pre-labeled datasets (source-domain task) with minimum labeling effort on unlabeled target data (target-domain task). Our strategy can yield positive transfer achieving a mean AUC gain of 10.5% compared to no transfer with a large 22b parameter PLM. We further show that annotation of just a few target-domain samples via active learning can be beneficial for transfer, but the impact diminishes with more annotation effort (26% drop in gain between 100 and 2000 annotated examples). Finally, we find that not all transfer scenarios yield a positive gain, which seems related to the PLMs initial performance on the target-domain task.","No"

To address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for both the model's belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model's beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph, improving over the raw model's predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute.

We first investigate the vanilla best-first search (BFS) algorithm and then propose the Best-$k$ Search algorithm. Inspired by BFS, we greedily expand the top $k$ nodes, instead of only the first node, to boost efficiency and diversity. Upweighting recently discovered nodes accompanied by heap pruning ensures the completeness of the search procedure.

We make the translation guidelines and corpus publicly available. We also report results for baseline systems for machine translation and speech translation tasks. We believe this is a valuable resource that can motivate and facilitate further research studying the code-switching phenomenon from a linguistic perspective and can be used to train and evaluate NLP systems.","No"
"Linear Interpolation In Parameter Space is Good Enough for Fine-Tuned Language Models","Mark Rofin, Nikita Balagansky, Daniil Gavrilov",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12092","The simplest way to obtain continuous interpolation between two points in high dimensional space is to draw a line between them. While previous works focused on the general connectivity between model parameters, we explored linear interpolation for parameters of pre-trained models after fine-tuning. Surprisingly, we could perform linear interpolation without a performance drop in intermediate points for fine-tuned models. For controllable text generation, such interpolation could be seen as moving a model towards or against the desired text attribute (e.g., positive sentiment), which could be used as grounds for further methods for controllable text generation without inference speed overhead.","No"
"HaRiM$^+$: Evaluating Summary Quality with Hallucination Risk","Seonil Son, Junsoo Park, Jeong-in Hwang, Junghwa Lee, Hyungjong Noh, Yeonsoo Lee",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12118","One of the challenges of developing a summarization model arises from the difficulty in measuring the factual inconsistency of the generated text. In this study, we reinterpret the decoder overconfidence-regularizing objective suggested in (Miao et al., 2021) as a hallucination risk measurement to better estimate the quality of generated summaries. We propose a reference-free metric, HaRiM+, which only requires an off-the-shelf summarization model to compute the hallucination risk based on token likelihoods. Deploying it requires no additional training of models or ad-hoc modules, which usually need alignment to human judgments. For summary-quality estimation, HaRiM+ records state-of-the-art correlation to human judgment on three summary-quality annotation sets: FRANK, QAGS, and SummEval. We hope that our work, which merits the use of summarization models, facilitates the progress of both automated evaluation and generation of summary.","No"

VENCE formulates the FEC problem as iterative sampling editing actions with respect to a target density function. We carefully design the target function with predicted truthfulness scores from an offline trained fact verification model. VENCE samples the most probable editing positions based on back-calculated gradients of the truthfulness score concerning input tokens and the editing actions using a distantly-supervised language model (T5). Experiments on a public dataset show that VENCE improves the well-adopted SARI metric by 5.3 (or a relative improvement of 11.8%) over the previous best distantly-supervised methods.","No"

"PESE: Event Structure Extraction using Pointer Network based Encoder-Decoder Architecture","Alapan Kuila and Sudeshan Sarkar",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12157","The task of event extraction (EE) aims to find the events and event-related argument information from the text and represent them in a structured format. Most previous works try to solve the problem by separately identifying multiple substructures and aggregating them to get the complete event structure.

In this paper, we represent each event record in a unique tuple format that contains trigger phrase, trigger type, argument phrase, and corresponding role information. Our proposed pointer network-based encoder-decoder model generates an event tuple in each time step by exploiting the interactions among event participants and presenting a truly end-to-end solution to the EE task.

"OLGA : An Ontology and LSTM-based approach for generating Arithmetic Word Problems (AWPs) of transfer type","Suresh Kumar and P Sreenivasa Kumar",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12164","Machine generation of Arithmetic Word Problems (AWPs) is challenging as they express quantities and mathematical relationships and need to be consistent. ML-solvers require a large annotated training set of consistent problems with language variations. Exploiting domain-knowledge is needed for consistency checking whereas LSTM-based approaches are good for producing text with language variations. Combining these we propose a system, OLGA, to generate consistent word problems of TC (Transfer-Case) type, involving object transfers among agents. Though we provide a dataset of consistent 2-agent TC-problems for training, only about 36% of the outputs of an LSTM-based generator are found consistent. We use an extension of TC-Ontology, proposed by us previously, to determine the consistency of problems. Among the remaining 64%, about 40% have minor errors which we repair using the same ontology. To check consistency and for the repair process, we construct an instance-specific representation (ABox) of an auto-generated problem. We use a sentence classifier and BERT models for this task. The training set for these LMs is problem-texts where sentence-parts are annotated with ontology class-names. As three-agent problems are longer, the percentage of consistent problems generated by an LSTM-based approach drops further. Hence, we propose an ontology-based method that extends consistent 2-agent problems into consistent 3-agent problems. Overall, our approach generates a large number of consistent TC-type AWPs involving 2 or 3 agents. As ABox has all the information of a problem, any annotations can also be generated. Adopting the proposed approach to generate other types of AWPs is interesting future work.","No"
"A Scope Sensitive and Result Attentive Model for Multi-Intent Spoken Language Understanding","Lizhi Cheng, Wenmian Yang, Weijia Jia",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12220","Multi-Intent Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), a novel and more complex scenario of SLU, is attracting increasing attention. Unlike traditional SLU, each intent in this scenario has its specific scope. Semantic information outside the scope even hinders the prediction, which tremendously increases the difficulty of intent detection. More seriously, guiding slot filling with these inaccurate intent labels suffers error propagation problems, resulting in unsatisfied overall performance. To solve these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Scope-Sensitive Result Attention Network (SSRAN) based on Transformer, which contains a Scope Recognizer (SR) and a Result Attention Network (RAN). Scope Recognizer assignments scope information to each token, reducing the distraction of out-of-scope tokens. Result Attention Network effectively utilizes the bidirectional interaction between results of slot filling and intent detection, mitigating the error propagation problem. Experiments on two public datasets indicate that our model significantly improves SLU performance (5.4\% and 2.1\% on Overall accuracy) over the state-of-the-art baseline.","No"

Gathering neurobiological data however, is costly and time-consuming. Another potential source of information, which is already part of the clinical routine, are therapist-patient dialogues. While there are some pioneering works investigating the role of language as predictors for various therapeutic parameters, for example patient-therapist alliance, there are no large-scale studies. A major obstacle to conduct these studies is the availability of sizeable datasets, which are needed to train machine learning models. While these conversations are part of the daily routine of clinicians, gathering them is usually hindered by various ethical (purpose of data usage), legal (data privacy) and technical (data formatting) limitations. Some of these limitations are particular to the domain of therapy dialogues, like the increased difficulty in anonymisation, or the transcription of the recordings.

"An Emotion-Aware Multi-Task Approach to Fake News and Rumour Detection using Transfer Learning","Arjun Choudhry, Inder Khatri, Minni Jain, Dinesh Kumar Vishwakarma",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12374","Social networking sites, blogs, and online articles are instant sources of news for internet users globally. However, in the absence of strict regulations mandating the genuineness of every text on social media, it is probable that some of these texts are fake news or rumours. Their deceptive nature and ability to propagate instantly can have an adverse effect on society. This necessitates the need for more effective detection of fake news and rumours on the web. In this work, we annotate four fake news detection and rumour detection datasets with their emotion class labels using transfer learning. We show the correlation between the legitimacy of a text with its intrinsic emotion for fake news and rumour detection, and prove that even within the same emotion class, fake and real news are often represented differently, which can be used for improved feature extraction. Based on this, we propose a multi-task framework for fake news and rumour detection, predicting both the emotion and legitimacy of the text. We train a variety of deep learning models in single-task and multi-task settings for a more comprehensive comparison. We further analyze the performance of our multi-task approach for fake news detection in cross-domain settings to verify its efficacy for better generalization across datasets, and to verify that emotions act as a domain-independent feature. Experimental results verify that our multi-task models consistently outperform their single-task counterparts in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, both for in-domain and cross-domain settings. We also qualitatively analyze the difference in performance in single-task and multi-task learning models.","No"

Using contrastive learning methods, we show how modern artificial neural networks can be leveraged to distill stories and extract a representation of the narrative information. We then demonstrate how evolutionary algorithms can leverage this to extract a set of narrative templates and how these templates -- in tandem with a novel curve-fitting algorithm we introduce -- can reorder music albums to automatically induce stories in them. In the process of doing so, we give strong statistical evidence that these narrative information templates are present in existing albums. While we experiment only with music albums here, the premises of our work extend to any form of (largely) independent media.","No"

We propose HyperTuning, a novel approach to model adaptation that uses a hypermodel to generate task-specific parameters for a fixed downstream model. We demonstrate a simple setup for hypertuning with HyperT5, a T5-based hypermodel that produces soft prefixes or LoRA parameters for a frozen T5 model from few-shot examples. We train HyperT5 in two stages: first, hyperpretraining with a modified conditional language modeling objective that trains a hypermodel to generate parameters; second, multi-task fine-tuning (MTF) on a large number of diverse language tasks. We evaluate HyperT5 on P3, MetaICL and Super-NaturalInstructions datasets, and show that it can effectively generate parameters for unseen tasks. Moreover, we show that using hypermodel-generated parameters as initializations for further parameter-efficient fine-tuning improves performance. HyperTuning can thus be a flexible and efficient way to leverage large language models for diverse downstream applications.","No"

Although their remarkable performance has been mostly attributed to the self-attention mechanism, the literature still lacks a solid analysis of these networks and interpretation of the functions learned by them. To this end, we study the training problem of attention/transformer networks and introduce a novel convex analytic approach to improve the understanding and optimization of these networks. Particularly, we first introduce a convex alternative to the self-attention mechanism and reformulate the regularized training problem of transformer networks with our alternative convex attention. Then, we cast the reformulation as a convex optimization problem that is interpretable and easier to optimize. Moreover, as a byproduct of our convex analysis, we reveal an implicit regularization mechanism, which promotes sparsity across tokens. Therefore, we not only improve the optimization of attention/transformer networks but also provide a solid theoretical understanding of the functions learned by them. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our theory through several numerical experiments.","No"

CKE from text is known for suffering from the inherent sparsity and reporting bias of commonsense in text. Visual perception, on the other hand, contains rich commonsense knowledge about real-world entities, e.g., (person, can_hold, bottle), which can serve as promising sources for acquiring grounded commonsense knowledge. In this work, we present CLEVER, which formulates CKE as a distantly supervised multi-instance learning problem, where models learn to summarize commonsense relations from a bag of images about an entity pair without any human annotation on image instances. To address the problem, CLEVER leverages vision-language pre-training models for deep understanding of each image in the bag, and selects informative instances from the bag to summarize commonsense entity relations via a novel contrastive attention mechanism. Comprehensive experimental results in held-out and human evaluation show that CLEVER can extract commonsense knowledge in promising quality, outperforming pre-trained language model-based methods by 3.9 AUC and 6.4 mAUC points. The predicted commonsense scores show strong correlation with human judgment with a 0.78 Spearman coefficient. Moreover, the extracted commonsense can also be grounded into images with reasonable interpretability. The data and codes can be obtained at https://github.com/thunlp/CLEVER.","No"

Beyond text and image generation, in this work, we explore the possibility of utilizing text descriptions to guide speech synthesis. Thus, we develop a text-to-speech (TTS) system (dubbed as PromptTTS) that takes a prompt with both style and content descriptions as input to synthesize the corresponding speech. Specifically, PromptTTS consists of a style encoder and a content encoder to extract the corresponding representations from the prompt, and a speech decoder to synthesize speech according to the extracted style and content representations. Compared with previous works in controllable TTS that require users to have acoustic knowledge to understand style factors such as prosody and pitch, PromptTTS is more user-friendly since text descriptions are a more natural way to express speech style (e.g., ''A lady whispers to her friend slowly''). Given that there is no TTS dataset with prompts, to benchmark the task of PromptTTS, we construct and release a dataset containing prompts with style and content information and the corresponding speech. Experiments show that PromptTTS can generate speech with precise style control and high speech quality. Audio samples and our dataset are publicly available.","No"
"Relation-dependent Contrastive Learning with Cluster Sampling for Inductive Relation Prediction","Jianfeng Wu, Sijie Mai, Haifeng Hu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12266","Relation prediction is a task designed for knowledge graph completion which aims to predict missing relationships between entities. Recent subgraph-based models for inductive relation prediction have received increasing attention, which can predict relation for unseen entities based on the extracted subgraph surrounding the candidate triplet. However, they are not completely inductive because of their disability of predicting unseen relations. Moreover, they fail to pay sufficient attention to the role of relation as they only depend on the model to learn parameterized relation embedding, which leads to inaccurate prediction on long-tail relations. In this paper, we introduce Relation-dependent Contrastive Learning (ReCoLe) for inductive relation prediction, which adapts contrastive learning with a novel sampling method based on clustering algorithm to enhance the role of relation and improve the generalization ability to unseen relations. Instead of directly learning embedding for relations, ReCoLe allocates a pre-trained GNN-based encoder to each relation to strengthen the influence of relation. The GNN-based encoder is optimized by contrastive learning, which ensures satisfactory performance on long-tail relations. In addition, the cluster sampling method equips ReCoLe with the ability to handle both unseen relations and entities. Experimental results suggest that ReCoLe outperforms state-of-the-art methods on commonly used inductive datasets.","No"

This raises the question of why Transformers perform well in practice and whether they have any properties that enable them to generalize better than recurrent models. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study on Boolean functions to demonstrate the following: (i) Random Transformers are relatively more biased towards functions of low sensitivity. (ii) When trained on Boolean functions, both Transformers and LSTMs prioritize learning functions of low sensitivity, with Transformers ultimately converging to functions of lower sensitivity. (iii) On sparse Boolean functions which have low sensitivity, we find that Transformers generalize near perfectly even in the presence of noisy labels whereas LSTMs overfit and achieve poor generalization accuracy. Overall, our results provide strong quantifiable evidence that suggests differences in the inductive biases of Transformers and recurrent models which may help explain Transformer's effective generalization performance despite relatively limited expressiveness.","No"

"A Continuum of Generation Tasks for Investigating Length Bias and Degenerate Repetition","Darcey Riley, David Chiang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10817","Language models suffer from various degenerate behaviors.

To study this question directly, we introduce a new experimental framework that allows us to smoothly vary task constrainedness, from MT at one end to fully open-ended generation at the other, while keeping all other aspects fixed. We find that: (1) repetition decreases smoothly with constrainedness, explaining the difference in repetition across tasks; (2) length bias surprisingly also decreases with constrainedness, suggesting some other cause for the difference in length bias; (3) across the board, these problems affect the mode, not the whole distribution; (4) the differences cannot be attributed to a change in the entropy of the distribution, since another method of changing the entropy, label smoothing, does not produce the same effect.","No"

Across multiple hate speech datasets annotated for targeted identities, we find that classifiers trained on hate speech targeting specific identity groups struggle to generalize to other targeted identities. This provides empirical evidence for differences in hate speech by target identity; we then investigate which patterns structure this variation. We find that the targeted demographic category (e.g. gender/sexuality or race/ethnicity) appears to have a greater effect on the language of hate speech than does the relative social power of the targeted identity group. We also find that words associated with hate speech targeting specific identities often relate to stereotypes, histories of oppression, current social movements, and other social contexts specific to identities. These experiments suggest the importance of considering targeted identity, as well as the social contexts associated with these identities, in automated hate speech classification.","No"
"Prompting through Prototype: A Prototype-based Prompt Learning on Pretrained Vision-Language Models","Yue Zhang, Hongliang Fei, Dingcheng Li, Tan Yu, Ping Li",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10841","Prompt learning is a new learning paradigm which reformulates downstream tasks as similar pretraining tasks on pretrained models by leveraging textual prompts. Recent works have demonstrated that prompt learning is particularly useful for few-shot learning, where there is limited training data. Depending on the granularity of prompts, those methods can be roughly divided into task-level prompting and instance-level prompting. Task-level prompting methods learn one universal prompt for all input samples, which is efficient but ineffective to capture subtle differences among different classes. Instance-level prompting methods learn a specific prompt for each input, though effective but inefficient. In this work, we develop a novel prototype-based prompt learning method to overcome the above limitations. In particular, we focus on few-shot image recognition tasks on pretrained vision-language models (PVLMs) and develop a method of prompting through prototype (PTP), where we define $K$ image prototypes and $K$ prompt prototypes. In PTP, the image prototype represents a centroid of a certain image cluster in the latent space and a prompt prototype is defined as a soft prompt in the continuous space. The similarity between a query image and an image prototype determines how much this prediction relies on the corresponding prompt prototype. Hence, in PTP, similar images will utilize similar prompting ways. Through extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks, we show that PTP is an effective method to leverage the latent knowledge and adaptive to various PVLMs. Moreover, through detailed analysis, we discuss pros and cons for prompt learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning under the context of few-shot learning.","No"

Using hard multiple-choice reading comprehension questions as a testbed, we assess whether presenting humans with arguments for two competing answer options, where one is correct and the other is incorrect, allows human judges to perform more accurately, even when one of the arguments is unreliable and deceptive. If this is helpful, we may be able to increase our justified trust in language-model-based systems by asking them to produce these arguments where needed. Previous research has shown that just a single turn of arguments in this format is not helpful to humans. However, as debate settings are characterized by a back-and-forth dialogue, we follow up on previous results to test whether adding a second round of counter-arguments is helpful to humans. We find that, regardless of whether they have access to arguments or not, humans perform similarly on our task. These findings suggest that, in the case of answering reading comprehension questions, debate is not a helpful format.","No"

Yet, a common challenge is to adapt QA models to an unseen target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised framework called QADA for QA domain adaptation. QADA introduces a novel data augmentation pipeline used to augment training QA samples. Different from existing methods, we enrich the samples via hidden space augmentation. For questions, we introduce multi-hop synonyms and sample augmented token embeddings with Dirichlet distributions. For contexts, we develop an augmentation method which learns to drop context spans via a custom attentive sampling strategy. Additionally, contrastive learning is integrated in the proposed self-supervised adaptation framework QADA. Unlike existing approaches, we generate pseudo labels and propose to train the model via a novel attention-based contrastive adaptation method. The attention weights are used to build informative features for discrepancy estimation that helps the QA model separate answers and generalize across source and target domains. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to leverage hidden space augmentation and attention-based contrastive adaptation for self-supervised domain adaptation in QA. Our evaluation shows that QADA achieves considerable improvements on multiple target datasets over state-of-the-art baselines in QA domain adaptation.","No"

On both perplexity and across several downstream tasks in the target domain, it consistently outperforms random selection with 20x less data, 3x fewer training iterations, and 2x less estimated cloud compute cost, validating the recipe of automatic document selection for LM pretraining.","No"
"Improving Chinese Spelling Check by Character Pronunciation Prediction: The Effects of Adaptivity and Granularity","Jiahao Li, Quan Wang, Zhendong Mao, Junbo Guo, Yanyan Yang, Yongdong Zhang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10996","Chinese spelling check (CSC) is a fundamental NLP task that detects and corrects spelling errors in Chinese texts. As most of these spelling errors are caused by phonetic similarity, effectively modeling the pronunciation of Chinese characters is a key factor for CSC. In this paper, we consider introducing an auxiliary task of Chinese pronunciation prediction (CPP) to improve CSC, and, for the first time, systematically discuss the adaptivity and granularity of this auxiliary task. We propose SCOPE which builds on top of a shared encoder two parallel decoders, one for the primary CSC task and the other for a fine-grained auxiliary CPP task, with a novel adaptive weighting scheme to balance the two tasks. In addition, we design a delicate iterative correction strategy for further improvements during inference. Empirical evaluation shows that SCOPE achieves new state-of-the-art on three CSC benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of the auxiliary CPP task. Comprehensive ablation studies further verify the positive effects of adaptivity and granularity of the task.

"Pre-trained Sentence Embeddings for Implicit Discourse Relation Classification","Murali Raghu Babu Balusu, Yangfeng Ji and Jacob Eisenstein",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11005","Implicit discourse relations bind smaller linguistic units into coherent texts. Automatic sense prediction for implicit relations is hard, because it requires understanding the semantics of the linked arguments.

In this paper, we explore the utility of pre-trained sentence embeddings as base representations in a neural network for implicit discourse relation sense classification. We present a series of experiments using both supervised end-to-end trained models and pre-trained sentence encoding techniques - SkipThought, Sent2vec and Infersent. The pre-trained embeddings are competitive with the end-to-end model, and the approaches are complementary, with combined models yielding significant performance improvements on two of the three evaluations.","No"

Although such a method is straightforward, the potential of diverse information in the intermediate layers is overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on contrastive learning that encourages intermediate features to learn layer-specialized representations and assembles them implicitly into a single representation to absorb rich information in the pre-trained language model.

Compared to prior datasets that either focus on a single structural type or overlook the role of questioning to uncover user needs, the Doc2Bot dataset is developed to target such challenges systematically. Our dataset contains over 100,000 turns based on Chinese documents from five domains, larger than any prior document-grounded dialog dataset for information seeking. We propose three tasks in Doc2Bot: (1) dialog state tracking to track user intentions, (2) dialog policy learning to plan system actions and contents, and (3) response generation which generates responses based on the outputs of the dialog policy. Baseline methods based on the latest deep learning models are presented, indicating that our proposed tasks are challenging and worthy of further research.","No"

By injecting the backdoor in sentence embeddings, BadCSE is resistant against downstream fine-tuning. We evaluate BadCSE on both STS tasks and other downstream tasks. The supervised non-targeted attack obtains a performance degradation of 194.86%, and the targeted attack maps the backdoored samples to the target embedding with a 97.70% success rate while maintaining the model utility.","No"

However, some analyses reveal that PLMs fail to perform it robustly, e.g., being sensitive to the changes of prompts when extracting factual knowledge. To mitigate this issue, we propose to let PLMs learn the deterministic relationship between the remaining context and the masked content. The deterministic relationship ensures that the masked factual content can be deterministically inferable based on the existing clues in the context. That would provide more stable patterns for PLMs to capture factual knowledge than randomly masking. Two pre-training tasks are further introduced to motivate PLMs to rely on the deterministic relationship when filling masks. Specifically, we use an external Knowledge Base (KB) to identify deterministic relationships and continuously pre-train PLMs with the proposed methods. The factual knowledge probing experiments indicate that the continuously pre-trained PLMs achieve better robustness in factual knowledge capturing. Further experiments on question-answering datasets show that trying to learn a deterministic relationship with the proposed methods can also help other knowledge-intensive tasks.","No"
"Wait-info Policy: Balancing Source and Target at Information Level for Simultaneous Machine Translation","Shaolei Zhang, Shoutao Guo, Yang Feng",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11220","Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) outputs the translation while receiving the source inputs, and hence needs to balance the received source information and translated target information to make a reasonable decision between waiting for inputs or outputting translation. Previous methods always balance source and target information at the token level, either directly waiting for a fixed number of tokens or adjusting the waiting based on the current token. In this paper, we propose a Wait-info Policy to balance source and target at the information level. We first quantify the amount of information contained in each token, named info. Then during simultaneous translation, the decision of waiting or outputting is made based on the comparison results between the total info of previous target outputs and received source inputs.

In this paper, we propose to generate quantitative evidence to predict which LM, out of a pool of models, will perform best on a target task without having to fine-tune all candidates. We provide a comprehensive study on LM ranking for 10 NLP tasks spanning the two fundamental problem types of classification and structured prediction. We adopt the state-of-the-art Logarithm of Maximum Evidence (LogME) measure from Computer Vision (CV) and find that it positively correlates with final LM performance in 94% of the setups. In the first study of its kind, we further compare transferability measures with the de facto standard of human practitioner ranking, finding that evidence from quantitative metrics is more robust than pure intuition and can help identify unexpected LM candidates.","No"

Inspired by dual-process theory in cognitive science, the representation module (automatic thinking) and reasoning modules (controlled thinking) are disentangled to capture different levels of cognition. Upon the top of the representation module, the pre-trained reasoning modules are modular and expertise in specific and fundamental reasoning skills (e.g., logic, simple QA, etc). To mimic the controlled compositional thinking process, different reasoning modules are dynamically activated and composed in both parallel and cascaded manners to control what reasoning skills are activated and how deep the reasoning process will be reached to solve the current problems. The unified reasoning framework solves multiple tasks with a single model,and is trained and inferred in an end-to-end manner. Evaluated on 11 datasets requiring different reasoning skills and complexity, ReasonFormer demonstrates substantial performance boosts, revealing the compositional reasoning ability. Few-shot experiments exhibit better generalization ability by learning to compose pre-trained skills for new tasks with limited data,and decoupling the representation module and the reasoning modules. Further analysis shows the modularity of reasoning modules as different tasks activate distinct reasoning skills at different reasoning depths.","No"

Although it is parameter- and deployment-efficient, its performance still lags behind other state-of-the-art PETuning methods. Besides, the training cost of prompt tuning is not significantly reduced due to the back-propagation through the entire model. Through empirical analyses, we shed some light on the lagging performance of prompt tuning and recognize a trade-off between the propagation distance from label signals to the inserted prompt and the influence of the prompt on model outputs. Further, we present Late Prompt Tuning (LPT) that inserts a late prompt into an intermediate layer of the PTM instead of the input layer or all layers. The late prompt is obtained by a neural prompt generator conditioned on the hidden states before the prompt insertion layer and therefore is instance-dependent. Through extensive experimental results across various tasks and PTMs, we show that LPT can achieve competitive performance to full model tuning and other PETuning methods under both full-data and few-shot scenarios while possessing faster training speed and lower memory cost.","No"

More data is needed, but annotating hateful content is expensive, time-consuming and potentially harmful to annotators. To mitigate these issues, we explore data-efficient strategies for expanding hate speech detection into under-resourced languages. In a series of experiments with mono- and multilingual models across five non-English languages, we find that 1) a small amount of target-language fine-tuning data is needed to achieve strong performance, 2) the benefits of using more such data decrease exponentially, and 3) initial fine-tuning on readily-available English data can partially substitute target-language data and improve model generalisability. Based on these findings, we formulate actionable recommendations for hate speech detection in low-resource language settings.","No"

This paper proposes UL2R, a method that substantially improves existing language models and their scaling curves with a relatively tiny amount of extra compute. The key idea is to continue training a state-of-the-art large language model (e.g., PaLM) on a few more steps with UL2's mixture-of-denoiser objective. We show that, with almost negligible extra computational costs and no new sources of data, we are able to substantially improve the scaling properties of large language models on downstream metrics. In this paper, we continue training PaLM with UL2R, introducing a new set of models at 8B, 62B, and 540B scale which we call U-PaLM. Impressively, at 540B scale, we show an approximately 2x computational savings rate where U-PaLM achieves the same performance as the final PaLM 540B model at around half its computational budget (i.e., saving $\sim$4.4 million TPUv4 hours). We further show that this improved scaling curve leads to 'emergent abilities' on challenging BIG-Bench tasks -- for instance, U-PaLM does much better than PaLM on some tasks or demonstrates better quality at much smaller scale (62B as opposed to 540B). Overall, we show that U-PaLM outperforms PaLM on many few-shot setups, i.e., English NLP tasks (e.g., commonsense reasoning, question answering), reasoning tasks with chain-of-thought (e.g., GSM8K), multilingual tasks (MGSM, TydiQA), MMLU and challenging BIG-Bench tasks.

In this paper, we investigate whether pretrained language models can perform compositional generalization in a realistic setting: recipe generation. We design the counterfactual recipe generation task, which asks models to modify a base recipe according to the change of an ingredient. This task requires compositional generalization at two levels: the surface level of incorporating the new ingredient into the base recipe, and the deeper level of adjusting actions related to the changing ingredient. We collect a large-scale recipe dataset in Chinese for models to learn culinary knowledge, and a subset of action-level fine-grained annotations for evaluation. We finetune pretrained language models on the recipe corpus, and use unsupervised counterfactual generation methods to generate modified recipes. Results show that existing models have difficulties in modifying the ingredients while preserving the original text style, and often miss actions that need to be adjusted. Although pretrained language models can generate fluent recipe texts, they fail to truly learn and use the culinary knowledge in a compositional way.

In this position paper, we assess the current paradigm of gender bias evaluation and identify several flaws in it. First, we highlight the importance of extrinsic bias metrics that measure how a model's performance on some task is affected by gender, as opposed to intrinsic evaluations of model representations, which are less strongly connected to specific harms to people interacting with systems. We find that only a few extrinsic metrics are measured in most studies, although more can be measured. Second, we find that datasets and metrics are often coupled, and discuss how their coupling hinders the ability to obtain reliable conclusions, and how one may decouple them. We then investigate how the choice of the dataset and its composition, as well as the choice of the metric, affect bias measurement, finding significant variations across each of them. Finally, we propose several guidelines for more reliable gender bias evaluation.","No"

Especially for image captioning, the attention based models are expected to ground correct image regions with proper generated words. However, for each time step in the decoding process, the attention based models usually use the hidden state of the current input to attend to the image regions. Under this setting, these attention models have a 'deviated focus' problem that they calculate the attention weights based on previous words instead of the one to be generated, impairing the performance of both grounding and captioning. In this paper, we propose the Prophet Attention, similar to the form of self-supervision. In the training stage, this module utilizes the future information to calculate the 'ideal' attention weights towards image regions. These calculated 'ideal' weights are further used to regularize the 'deviated' attention. In this manner, image regions are grounded with the correct words. The proposed Prophet Attention can be easily incorporated into existing image captioning models to improve their performance of both grounding and captioning. The experiments on the Flickr30k Entities and the MSCOCO datasets show that the proposed Prophet Attention consistently outperforms baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. It is worth noticing that we set new state-of-the-arts on the two benchmark datasets and achieve the 1st place on the leaderboard of the online MSCOCO benchmark in terms of the default ranking score, i.e., CIDEr-c40.","No"

"Context-driven Visual Object Recognition based on Knowledge Graphs","Sebastian Monka, Lavdim Halilaj, Achim Rettinger",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11233","Current deep learning methods for object recognition are purely data-driven and require a large number of training samples to achieve good results. Due to their sole dependence on image data, these methods tend to fail when confronted with new environments where even small deviations occur. Human perception, however, has proven to be significantly more robust to such distribution shifts. It is assumed that their ability to deal with unknown scenarios is based on extensive incorporation of contextual knowledge. Context can be based either on object co-occurrences in a scene or on memory of experience. In accordance with the human visual cortex which uses context to form different object representations for a seen image, we propose an approach that enhances deep learning methods by using external contextual knowledge encoded in a knowledge graph. Therefore, we extract different contextual views from a generic knowledge graph, transform the views into vector space and infuse it into a DNN. We conduct a series of experiments to investigate the impact of different contextual views on the learned object representations for the same image dataset. The experimental results provide evidence that the contextual views influence the image representations in the DNN differently and therefore lead to different predictions for the same images. We also show that context helps to strengthen the robustness of object recognition models for out-of-distribution images, usually occurring in transfer learning tasks or real-world scenarios.","No"

However, the heavy labour cost of constructing graph annotations may hinder the application of PSG in practical scenarios. Inspired by the observation that people usually identify the subject and object first and then determine the relationship between them, we proposed to decouple the scene graphs generation task into two sub-tasks: 1) an image segmentation task to pick up the qualified objects. 2) a restricted auto-regressive text generation task to generate the relation between given objects.

We find that instruction finetuning with the above aspects dramatically improves performance on a variety of model classes (PaLM, T5, U-PaLM), prompting setups (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT), and evaluation benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA, MGSM, open-ended generation). For instance, Flan-PaLM 540B instruction-finetuned on 1.8K tasks outperforms PALM 540B by a large margin (+9.4% on average). Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2% on five-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints, which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B.

Puns, in particular, add the challenge of fusing that knowledge with the ability to interpret lexical-semantic ambiguity. In this paper, we present the ExPUNations (ExPUN) dataset, in which we augment an existing dataset of puns with detailed crowdsourced annotations of keywords denoting the most distinctive words that make the text funny, pun explanations describing why the text is funny, and fine-grained funniness ratings. This is the first humor dataset with such extensive and fine-grained annotations specifically for puns. Based on these annotations, we propose two tasks: explanation generation to aid with pun classification and keyword-conditioned pun generation, to challenge the current state-of-the-art natural language understanding and generation models' ability to understand and generate humor. We showcase that the annotated keywords we collect are helpful for generating better novel humorous texts in human evaluation, and that our natural language explanations can be leveraged to improve both the accuracy and robustness of humor classifiers.","No"

While this may enable efficient pun generation, we believe that a pun is most entertaining if it fits appropriately within a given context, e.g., a given situation or dialogue. In this work, we propose a new task, context-situated pun generation, where a specific context represented by a set of keywords is provided, and the task is to first identify suitable pun words that are appropriate for the context, then generate puns based on the context keywords and the identified pun words. We collect CUP (Context-sitUated Pun), containing 4.5k tuples of context words and pun pairs. Based on the new data and setup, we propose a pipeline system for context-situated pun generation, including a pun word retrieval module that identifies suitable pun words for a given context, and a generation module that generates puns from context keywords and pun words. Human evaluation shows that 69% of our top retrieved pun words can be used to generate context-situated puns, and our generation module yields successful puns 31% of the time given a plausible tuple of context words and pun pair, almost tripling the yield of a state-of-the-art pun generation model. With an end-to-end evaluation, our pipeline system with the top-1 retrieved pun pair for a given context can generate successful puns 40% of the time, better than all other modeling variations but 32% lower than the human success rate. This highlights the difficulty of the task, and encourages more research in this direction.","No"

"Characterizing Verbatim Short-Term Memory in Neural Language Models","Kristijan Armeni, Christopher Honey, Tal Linzen",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13569","When a language model is trained to predict natural language sequences, its prediction at each moment depends on a representation of prior context. What kind of information about the prior context can language models retrieve? We tested whether language models could retrieve the exact words that occurred previously in a text. In our paradigm, language models (transformers and an LSTM) processed English text in which a list of nouns occurred twice. We operationalized retrieval as the reduction in surprisal from the first to the second list. We found that the transformers retrieved both the identity and ordering of nouns from the first list. Further, the transformers' retrieval was markedly enhanced when they were trained on a larger corpus and with greater model depth. Lastly, their ability to index prior tokens was dependent on learned attention patterns. In contrast, the LSTM exhibited less precise retrieval, which was limited to list-initial tokens and to short intervening texts. The LSTM's retrieval was not sensitive to the order of nouns and it improved when the list was semantically coherent. We conclude that transformers implemented something akin to a working memory system that could flexibly retrieve individual token representations across arbitrary delays; conversely, the LSTM maintained a coarser and more rapidly-decaying semantic gist of prior tokens, weighted toward the earliest items.","No"
"Does Self-Rationalization Improve Robustness to Spurious Correlations?","Alexis Ross, Matthew E. Peters, Ana Marasovi\'c",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13575","Rationalization is fundamental to human reasoning and learning. NLP models trained to produce rationales along with predictions, called self-rationalization models, have been investigated for their interpretability and utility to end-users. However, the extent to which training with human-written rationales facilitates learning remains an under-explored question. We ask whether training models to self-rationalize can aid in their learning to solve tasks for the right reasons. Specifically, we evaluate how training self-rationalization models with free-text rationales affects robustness to spurious correlations in fine-tuned encoder-decoder and decoder-only models of six different sizes. We evaluate robustness to spurious correlations by measuring performance on 1) manually annotated challenge datasets and 2) subsets of original test sets where reliance on spurious correlations would fail to produce correct answers. We find that while self-rationalization can improve robustness to spurious correlations in low-resource settings, it tends to hurt robustness in higher-resource settings. Furthermore, these effects depend on model family and size, as well as on rationale content. Together, our results suggest that explainability can come at the cost of robustness; thus, appropriate care should be taken when training self-rationalizing models with the goal of creating more trustworthy models.","No"

Such facts are encoded implicitly within their many parameters, making it difficult to verify or manipulate what knowledge has been learned. Language models have recently been extended to multilingual language models (MLLMs), enabling knowledge to be learned across hundreds of languages. Meanwhile, knowledge graphs contain facts in an explicit triple format, which require careful and costly curation and are only available in a few high-resource languages, restricting their research and application. To address these issues, we propose to enhance MLLMs with knowledge from multilingual knowledge graphs (MLKGs) so as to tackle language and knowledge graph tasks across many languages, including low-resource ones. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight adapter set to enhance MLLMs with cross-lingual entity alignment and facts from MLKGs for many languages. Experiments on common benchmarks show that such enhancement benefits both MLLMs and MLKGs, achieving: (1) comparable or improved performance for knowledge graph completion and entity alignment relative to baselines, especially for low-resource languages (for which knowledge graphs are unavailable); and (2) improved MLLM performance on language understanding tasks that require multilingual factual knowledge; all while maintaining performance on other general language tasks.","No"
"Predicting Long-Term Citations from Short-Term Linguistic Influence","Sandeep Soni and David Bamman and Jacob Eisenstein",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13628","A standard measure of the influence of a research paper is the number of times it is cited. However, papers may be cited for many reasons, and citation count offers limited information about the extent to which a paper affected the content of subsequent publications. We therefore propose a novel method to quantify linguistic influence in timestamped document collections. There are two main steps: first, identify lexical and semantic changes using contextual embeddings and word frequencies; second, aggregate information about these changes into per-document influence scores by estimating a high-dimensional Hawkes process with a low-rank parameter matrix. We show that this measure of linguistic influence is predictive of $\textit{future}$ citations: the estimate of linguistic influence from the two years after a paper's publication is correlated with and predictive of its citation count in the following three years. This is demonstrated using an online evaluation with incremental temporal training/test splits, in comparison with a strong baseline that includes predictors for initial citation counts, topics, and lexical features.","No"

"ReaRev: Adaptive Reasoning for Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs","Costas Mavromatis, George Karypis",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13650","Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) involves retrieving entities as answers from a Knowledge Graph (KG) using natural language queries. The challenge is to learn to reason over question-relevant KG facts that traverse KG entities and lead to the question answers. To facilitate reasoning, the question is decoded into instructions, which are dense question representations used to guide the KG traversals. However, if the derived instructions do not exactly match the underlying KG information, they may lead to reasoning under irrelevant context. Our method, termed ReaRev, introduces a new way to KGQA reasoning with respect to both instruction decoding and execution. To improve instruction decoding, we perform reasoning in an adaptive manner, where KG-aware information is used to iteratively update the initial instructions. To improve instruction execution, we emulate breadth-first search (BFS) with graph neural networks (GNNs). The BFS strategy treats the instructions as a set and allows our method to decide on their execution order on the fly. Experimental results on three KGQA benchmarks demonstrate the ReaRev's effectiveness compared with previous state-of-the-art, especially when the KG is incomplete or when we tackle complex questions.

Our results show that for in-domain settings (a) there is a cross point of sample size for which PERMs will perform better than finetuning when training with fewer samples, and (b) larger PLMs have larger cross points.

However, these procedures are often misaligned in that training objectives do not exactly reflect the retrieval scenario at inference time. In this paper, we explore how the gap between training and inference in dense retrieval can be reduced, focusing on dense phrase retrieval (Lee et al., 2021) where billions of representations are indexed at inference. Since validating every dense retriever with a large-scale index is practically infeasible, we propose an efficient way of validating dense retrievers using a small subset of the entire corpus. This allows us to validate various training strategies including unifying contrastive loss terms and using hard negatives for phrase retrieval, which largely reduces the training-inference discrepancy. As a result, we improve top-1 phrase retrieval accuracy by 2~3 points and top-20 passage retrieval accuracy by 2~4 points for open-domain question answering. Our work urges modeling dense retrievers with careful consideration of training and inference via efficient validation while advancing phrase retrieval as a general solution for dense retrieval.","No"

However, existing work primarily focuses on English datasets, and it is unknown whether large language models can serve as competitive semantic parsers for other languages. To bridge this gap, our work focuses on cross-lingual Text-to-SQL semantic parsing for translating non-English utterances into SQL queries based on an English schema.

In this paper, we simulate knowledge conflicts (i.e., where parametric knowledge suggests one answer and different passages suggest different answers) and examine model behaviors. We find retrieval performance heavily impacts which sources models rely on, and current models mostly rely on non-parametric knowledge in their best-performing settings. We discover a troubling trend that contradictions among knowledge sources affect model confidence only marginally. To address this issue, we present a new calibration study, where models are discouraged from presenting any single answer when presented with multiple conflicting answer candidates in retrieved evidences.","No"

Unfortunately, parameter-efficient methods perform poorly with small amounts of data, which are common in the legal domain (where data labelling costs are high). To address these challenges, we propose parameter-efficient legal domain adaptation, which uses vast unsupervised legal data from public legal forums to perform legal pre-training. This method exceeds or matches the fewshot performance of existing models such as LEGAL-BERT on various legal tasks while tuning only approximately 0.1% of model parameters. Additionally, we show that our method can achieve calibration comparable to existing methods across several tasks.

The operations of newer learned metrics (e.g., BLEURT, COMET), which leverage pretrained language models to achieve higher correlations with human quality judgments than BLEU, are opaque in comparison. In this paper, we shed light on the behavior of these learned metrics by creating DEMETR, a diagnostic dataset with 31K English examples (translated from 10 source languages) for evaluating the sensitivity of MT evaluation metrics to 35 different linguistic perturbations spanning semantic, syntactic, and morphological error categories. All perturbations were carefully designed to form minimal pairs with the actual translation (i.e., differ in only one aspect). We find that learned metrics perform substantially better than string-based metrics on DEMETR. Additionally, learned metrics differ in their sensitivity to various phenomena (e.g., BERTScore is sensitive to untranslated words but relatively insensitive to gender manipulation, while COMET is much more sensitive to word repetition than to aspectual changes).

However, most MRC datasets only have answerable question type, overlooking the importance of unanswerable questions. MRC models trained only on answerable questions will select the span that is most likely to be the answer, even when the answer does not actually exist in the given passage (Rajpurkar et al., 2018). This problem especially remains in medium- to low-resource languages like Indonesian. Existing Indonesian MRC datasets (Purwarianti et al., 2007; Clark et al., 2020) are still inadequate because of the small size and limited question types, i.e., they only cover answerable questions. To fill this gap, we build a new Indonesian MRC dataset called I(n)don'tKnow- MRC (IDK-MRC) by combining the automatic and manual unanswerable question generation to minimize the cost of manual dataset construction while maintaining the dataset quality. Combined with the existing answerable questions, IDK-MRC consists of more than 10K questions in total.

Other than the importance of studying these testimonies for Holocaust research, we argue that they provide an interesting test case for topical segmentation, due to their unstructured surface level, relative abundance (tens of thousands of such testimonies were collected), and the relatively confined domain that they cover. We hypothesize that boundary points between segments correspond to low mutual information between the sentences proceeding and following the boundary. Based on this hypothesis, we explore a range of algorithmic approaches to the task, building on previous work on segmentation that uses generative Bayesian modeling and state-of-the-art neural machinery.

Our work is the first to demonstrate that reference-free, controlled sentence summarization is feasible via the conceptual framework of Symbolic Knowledge Distillation (West et al., 2022), where latent knowledge in pre-trained language models is distilled via explicit examples sampled from the teacher models, further purified with three types of filters: length, fidelity, and Information Bottleneck. Moreover, we uniquely propose iterative distillation of knowledge, where student models from the previous iteration of distillation serve as teacher models in the next iteration. Starting off from a relatively modest set of GPT3-generated summaries, we demonstrate how iterative knowledge distillation can lead to considerably smaller, but better summarizers with sharper controllability. A useful by-product of this iterative distillation process is a high-quality dataset of sentence-summary pairs with varying degrees of compression ratios.

Existing research aims to enhance the text representation and use multi-source information to improve the detection and correction capabilities of models, but does not pay too much attention to improving their ability to distinguish between confusable words. Contrastive learning, whose aim is to minimize the distance in representation space between similar sample pairs, has recently become a dominant technique in natural language processing. Inspired by contrastive learning, we present a novel framework for Chinese spelling checking, which consists of three modules: language representation, spelling check and reverse contrastive learning. Specifically, we propose a reverse contrastive learning strategy, which explicitly forces the model to minimize the agreement between the similar examples, namely, the phonetically and visually confusable characters. Experimental results show that our framework is model-agnostic and could be combined with existing Chinese spelling check models to yield state-of-the-art performance.","No"
"Information Filter upon Diversity-Improved Decoding for Diversity-Faithfulness Tradeoff in NLG","Han Meng, Xiaosong He, Zexing Chen, Feng Zhou",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13829","Some Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks require both faithfulness and diversity. The decoding strategy is intensively related to the quality of the generated text. Strategies such as beam search, greedy search, etc., perform with low diversity and high repetition. On the other hand, guided decoding, the solution towards diversity, may generate unfaithful expressions. To this end, this paper presents Information Filter upon Diversity-Improved Decoding (IFDID) to obtain the tradeoff between diversity and faithfulness. IFDID is a two-stage decoding strategy leveraging the proposed Enhance-Filter framework, which achieves the tradeoff by increasing the probabilities of some typical tokens being selected and subsequently filtering them by their information amount. To verify the effectiveness, we compare our method with other baselines on related CommonGEN, RocStories and AdGen benchmarks, which cover Chinese and English datasets. Our numerical experimental results and human evaluation outcomes verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, as our approach achieves a 1.24 higher ROUGE score describing faithfulness as well as higher diversity represented by 62.5% higher upon Dist-2 than traditional approaches, demonstrating that IFDID is a novel SOTA decoding strategy for the tradeoff between diversity and faithfulness.","No"
"FineD-Eval: Fine-grained Automatic Dialogue-Level Evaluation","Chen Zhang, Luis Fernando D'Haro, Qiquan Zhang, Thomas Friedrichs, Haizhou Li",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13832","Recent model-based reference-free metrics for open-domain dialogue evaluation exhibit promising correlations with human judgment. However, they either perform turn-level evaluation or look at a single dialogue quality dimension. One would expect a good evaluation metric to assess multiple quality dimensions at the dialogue level. To this end, we are motivated to propose a multi-dimensional dialogue-level metric, which consists of three sub-metrics with each targeting a specific dimension. The sub-metrics are trained with novel self-supervised objectives and exhibit strong correlations with human judgment for their respective dimensions. Moreover, we explore two approaches to combine the sub-metrics: metric ensemble and multitask learning. Both approaches yield a holistic metric that significantly outperforms individual sub-metrics. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art metric, the combined metrics achieve around 16% relative improvement on average across three high-quality dialogue-level evaluation benchmarks.","No"

"Multilingual Relation Classification via Efficient and Effective Prompting","Yuxuan Chen, David Harbecke, Leonhard Hennig",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13838","Prompting pre-trained language models has achieved impressive performance on various NLP tasks, especially in low data regimes. Despite the success of prompting in monolingual settings, applying prompt-based methods in multilingual scenarios has been limited to a narrow set of tasks, due to the high cost of handcrafting multilingual prompts. In this paper, we present the first work on prompt-based multilingual relation classification (RC), by introducing an efficient and effective method that constructs prompts from relation triples and involves only minimal translation for the class labels. We evaluate its performance in fully supervised, few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, and analyze its effectiveness across 14 languages, prompt variants, and English-task training in cross-lingual settings. We find that in both fully supervised and few-shot scenarios, our prompt method beats competitive baselines: fine-tuning XLM-R_EM and null prompts. It also outperforms the random baseline by a large margin in zero-shot experiments. Our method requires little in-language knowledge and can be used as a strong baseline for similar multilingual classification tasks.","No"

DialogConv is exclusively built on top of convolution to extract matching features of context and response. Dialogues are modeled in 3D views, where DialogConv performs convolution operations on embedding view, word view and utterance view to capture richer semantic information from multiple contextual views. On the four benchmark datasets, compared with state-of-the-art baselines, DialogConv is on average about 8.5x smaller in size, and 79.39x and 10.64x faster on CPU and GPU devices, respectively. At the same time, DialogConv achieves the competitive effectiveness of response selection.","No"
"Missing Counter-Evidence Renders NLP Fact-Checking Unrealistic for Misinformation","Max Glockner, Yufang Hou, Iryna Gurevych",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13865","Misinformation emerges in times of uncertainty when credible information is limited. This is challenging for NLP-based fact-checking as it relies on counter-evidence, which may not yet be available. Despite increasing interest in automatic fact-checking, it is still unclear if automated approaches can realistically refute harmful real-world misinformation. Here, we contrast and compare NLP fact-checking with how professional fact-checkers combat misinformation in the absence of counter-evidence. In our analysis, we show that, by design, existing NLP task definitions for fact-checking cannot refute misinformation as professional fact-checkers do for the majority of claims. We then define two requirements that the evidence in datasets must fulfill for realistic fact-checking: It must be (1) sufficient to refute the claim and (2) not leaked from existing fact-checking articles. We survey existing fact-checking datasets and find that all of them fail to satisfy both criteria. Finally, we perform experiments to demonstrate that models trained on a large-scale fact-checking dataset rely on leaked evidence, which makes them unsuitable in real-world scenarios. Taken together, we show that current NLP fact-checking cannot realistically combat real-world misinformation because it depends on unrealistic assumptions about counter-evidence in the data.","No"

In this work, we test the DUAL MECHANISM hypothesis that priming is driven by multiple different sources. Using a Hindi corpus of text productions, we model lexical priming with an n-gram cache model and we capture more abstract syntactic priming with an adaptive neural language model. We permute the preverbal constituents of corpus sentences, and then use a logistic regression model to predict which sentences actually occurred in the corpus against artificially generated meaning-equivalent variants. Our results indicate that lexical priming and lexically-independent syntactic priming affect complementary sets of verb classes. By showing that different priming influences are separable from one another, our results support the hypothesis that multiple different cognitive mechanisms underlie priming.","No"

While prior work has shown that a number of factors (e.g., information status, dependency length, and syntactic surprisal) influence Hindi word order preferences, the role of discourse predictability is underexplored in the literature. Inspired by prior work on syntactic priming, we investigate how the words and syntactic structures in a sentence influence the word order of the following sentences. Specifically, we extract sentences from the Hindi-Urdu Treebank corpus (HUTB), permute the preverbal constituents of those sentences, and build a classifier to predict which sentences actually occurred in the corpus against artificially generated distractors. The classifier uses a number of discourse-based features and cognitive features to make its predictions, including dependency length, surprisal, and information status. We find that information status and LSTM-based discourse predictability influence word order choices, especially for non-canonical object-fronted orders. We conclude by situating our results within the broader syntactic priming literature.","No"

"Learning to Reuse Distractors to support Multiple Choice Question Generation in Education","Semere Kiros Bitew, Amir Hadifar, Lucas Sterckx, Johannes Deleu, Chris Develder and Thomas Demeester",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13964","Multiple choice questions (MCQs) are widely used in digital learning systems, as they allow for automating the assessment process. However, due to the increased digital literacy of students and the advent of social media platforms, MCQ tests are widely shared online, and teachers are continuously challenged to create new questions, which is an expensive and time-consuming task. A particularly sensitive aspect of MCQ creation is to devise relevant distractors, i.e., wrong answers that are not easily identifiable as being wrong. This paper studies how a large existing set of manually created answers and distractors for questions over a variety of domains, subjects, and languages can be leveraged to help teachers in creating new MCQs, by the smart reuse of existing distractors. We built several data-driven models based on context-aware question and distractor representations, and compared them with static feature-based models. The proposed models are evaluated with automated metrics and in a realistic user test with teachers. Both automatic and human evaluations indicate that context-aware models consistently outperform a static feature-based approach. For our best-performing context-aware model, on average 3 distractors out of the 10 shown to teachers were rated as high-quality distractors. We create a performance benchmark, and make it public, to enable comparison between different approaches and to introduce a more standardized evaluation of the task. The benchmark contains a test of 298 educational questions covering multiple subjects & languages and a 77k multilingual pool of distractor vocabulary for future research.","No"

"Are All Spurious Features in Natural Language Alike? An Analysis through a Causal Lens","Nitish Joshi, Xiang Pan, He He",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14011","The term `spurious correlations' has been used in NLP to informally denote any undesirable feature-label correlations. However, a correlation can be undesirable because (i) the feature is irrelevant to the label (e.g. punctuation in a review), or (ii) the feature's effect on the label depends on the context (e.g. negation words in a review), which is ubiquitous in language tasks. In case (i), we want the model to be invariant to the feature, which is neither necessary nor sufficient for prediction. But in case (ii), even an ideal model (e.g. humans) must rely on the feature, since it is necessary (but not sufficient) for prediction. Therefore, a more fine-grained treatment of spurious features is needed to specify the desired model behavior. We formalize this distinction using a causal model and probabilities of necessity and sufficiency, which delineates the causal relations between a feature and a label. We then show that this distinction helps explain results of existing debiasing methods on different spurious features, and demystifies surprising results such as the encoding of spurious features in model representations after debiasing.","No"
"From exemplar to copy: the scribal appropriation of a Hadewijch manuscript computationally explored","Wouter Haverals, Mike Kestemont",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14061","This study is devoted to two of the oldest known manuscripts in which the oeuvre of the medieval mystical author Hadewijch has been preserved: Brussels, KBR, 2879-2880 (ms. A) and Brussels, KBR, 2877-2878 (ms. B). On the basis of codicological and contextual arguments, it is assumed that the scribe who produced B used A as an exemplar. While the similarities in both layout and content between the two manuscripts are striking, the present article seeks to identify the differences. After all, regardless of the intention to produce a copy that closely follows the exemplar, subtle linguistic variation is apparent. Divergences relate to spelling conventions, but also to the way in which words are abbreviated (and the extent to which abbreviations occur). The present study investigates the spelling profiles of the scribes who produced mss. A and B in a computational way. In the first part of this study, we will present both manuscripts in more detail, after which we will consider prior research carried out on scribal profiling. The current study both builds and expands on Kestemont (2015). Next, we outline the methodology used to analyse and measure the degree of scribal appropriation that took place when ms. B was copied off the exemplar ms. A. After this, we will discuss the results obtained, focusing on the scribal variation that can be found both at the level of individual words and n-grams. To this end, we use machine learning to identify the most distinctive features that separate manuscript A from B. Finally, we look at possible diachronic trends in the appropriation by B's scribe of his exemplar. We argue that scribal takeovers in the exemplar impacts the practice of the copying scribe, while transitions to a different content matter cause little to no effect.","No"

In this paper, we investigate the geometric connections of different minima through the lens of mode connectivity, which measures whether two minima can be connected with a low-loss path. We conduct empirical analyses to investigate three questions: (1) how could hyperparameters, specific tuning methods, and training data affect PLM's mode connectivity? (2) How does mode connectivity change during pre-training? (3) How does the PLM's task knowledge change along the path connecting two minima? In general, exploring the mode connectivity of PLMs conduces to understanding the geometric connection of different minima, which may help us fathom the inner workings of PLM downstream adaptation.","No"

Instead of focusing on pre-defined relations, we create an OIE benchmark aiming to fully examine the open relational information present in the pre-trained LMs. We accomplish this by turning pre-trained LMs into zero-shot OIE systems.

Hope is usually associated with concepts of desired expectations and possibility/probability concerning the future. Despite its importance, hope has rarely been studied as a social media analysis task. This paper presents a hope speech dataset that classifies each tweet first into 'Hope' and 'Not Hope', then into three fine-grained hope categories: 'Generalized Hope', 'Realistic Hope', and 'Unrealistic Hope' (along with 'Not Hope'). English tweets in the first half of 2022 were collected to build this dataset. Furthermore, we describe our annotation process and guidelines in detail and discuss the challenges of classifying hope and the limitations of the existing hope speech detection corpora. In addition, we reported several baselines based on different learning approaches, such as traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transformers, to benchmark our dataset. We evaluated our baselines using weighted-averaged and macro-averaged F1-scores. Observations show that a strict process for annotator selection and detailed annotation guidelines enhanced the dataset's quality. This strict annotation process resulted in promising performance for simple machine learning classifiers with only bi-grams; however, binary and multiclass hope speech detection results reveal that contextual embedding models have higher performance in this dataset.","No"
"Contrastive Search Is What You Need For Neural Text Generation","Yixuan Su and Nigel Collier",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14140","Generating text with autoregressive language models (LMs) is of great importance to many natural language processing (NLP) applications. Previous solutions for this task often produce text that contains degenerative expressions or lacks semantic consistency. Recently, Su et al. introduced a new decoding method, contrastive search, based on the isotropic representation space of the language model and obtained new state of the art on various benchmarks. Additionally, Su et al. argued that the representations of autoregressive LMs (e.g. GPT-2) are intrinsically anisotropic which is also shared by previous study. Therefore, to ensure the language model follows an isotropic distribution, Su et al. proposed a contrastive learning scheme, SimCTG, which calibrates the language model's representations through additional training. In this study, we first answer the question: 'Are autoregressive LMs really anisotropic?'. To this end, we extensively evaluate the isotropy of LMs across 16 major languages. Surprisingly, we find that the anisotropic problem only exists in the two specific English GPT-2-small/medium models. On the other hand, all other evaluated LMs are naturally isotropic which is in contrast to the conclusion drawn by previous studies. Based on our findings, we further assess the contrastive search decoding method using off-the-shelf LMs on four generation tasks across 16 languages. Our experimental results demonstrate that contrastive search significantly outperforms previous decoding methods without any additional training. More notably, on 12 out of 16 evaluated languages, contrastive search performs comparably with human-level performances as judged by human evaluations.","No"

"Adaptive Label Smoothing with Self-Knowledge in Natural Language Generation","Dongkyu Lee, Ka Chun Cheung, Nevin L. Zhang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13459","Overconfidence has been shown to impair generalization and calibration of a neural network. Previous studies remedy this issue by adding a regularization term to a loss function, preventing a model from making a peaked distribution. Label smoothing smoothes target labels with a pre-defined prior label distribution; as a result, a model is learned to maximize the likelihood of predicting the soft label. Nonetheless, the amount of smoothing is the same in all samples and remains fixed in training. In other words, label smoothing does not reflect the change in probability distribution mapped by a model over the course of training. To address this issue, we propose a regularization scheme that brings dynamic nature into the smoothing parameter by taking model probability distribution into account, thereby varying the parameter per instance. A model in training self-regulates the extent of smoothing on the fly during forward propagation. Furthermore, inspired by recent work in bridging label smoothing and knowledge distillation, our work utilizes self-knowledge as a prior label distribution in softening target labels, and presents theoretical support for the regularization effect by knowledge distillation and the dynamic smoothing parameter. Our regularizer is validated comprehensively, and the result illustrates marked improvements in model generalization and calibration, enhancing robustness and trustworthiness of a model.","No"

However, these state-of-the-art methods mainly suffer from three shortcomings: (i) incomprehensive optimization, (ii) low-order and unidimensional attention mechanisms, and (iii) repeated generation. In this article, we propose a hybrid reinforced medical report generation method with m-linear attention and repetition penalty mechanism (HReMRG-MR) to overcome these problems. Specifically, a hybrid reward with different weights is employed to remedy the limitations of single-metric-based rewards. We also propose a search algorithm with linear complexity to approximate the best weight combination. Furthermore, we use m-linear attention modules to explore high-order feature interactions and to achieve multi-modal reasoning, while a repetition penalty applies penalties to repeated terms during the model's training process. Extensive experimental studies on two public datasets show that HReMRG-MR greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of all metrics.

We pre-trained the model via these two approaches, and evaluated on two downstream tasks, phoneme classification and speaker recognition. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed masking approaches are beneficial to improve the performance of speech representation.","No"

From the experiment results on the public dataset of LJSpeech with four environment effects, the proposed model could complete the specific environment effect conversion and outperforms the baseline methods from the voice conversion task.","No"
"Differentially Private Language Models for Secure Data Sharing","Justus Mattern, Zhijing Jin, Benjamin Weggenmann, Bernhard Schoelkopf, Mrinmaya Sachan",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13918","To protect the privacy of individuals whose data is being shared, it is of high importance to develop methods allowing researchers and companies to release textual data while providing formal privacy guarantees to its originators. In the field of NLP, substantial efforts have been directed at building mechanisms following the framework of local differential privacy, thereby anonymizing individual text samples before releasing them. In practice, these approaches are often dissatisfying in terms of the quality of their output language due to the strong noise required for local differential privacy. In this paper, we approach the problem at hand using global differential privacy, particularly by training a generative language model in a differentially private manner and consequently sampling data from it. Using natural language prompts and a new prompt-mismatch loss, we are able to create highly accurate and fluent textual datasets taking on specific desired attributes such as sentiment or topic and resembling statistical properties of the training data. We perform thorough experiments indicating that our synthetic datasets do not leak information from our original data and are of high language quality and highly suitable for training models for further analysis on real-world data. Notably, we also demonstrate that training classifiers on private synthetic data outperforms directly training classifiers on real data with DP-SGD.","No"
"Entity Divider with Language Grounding in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning","Ziluo Ding, Wanpeng Zhang, Junpeng Yue, Xiangjun Wang, Tiejun Huang, and Zongqing Lu",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13942","We investigate the use of natural language to drive the generalization of policies in multi-agent settings. Unlike single-agent settings, the generalization of policies should also consider the influence of other agents. Besides, with the increasing number of entities in multi-agent settings, more agent-entity interactions are needed for language grounding, and the enormous search space could impede the learning process. Moreover, given a simple general instruction,e.g., beating all enemies, agents are required to decompose it into multiple subgoals and figure out the right one to focus on. Inspired by previous work, we try to address these issues at the entity level and propose a novel framework for language grounding in multi-agent reinforcement learning, entity divider (EnDi). EnDi enables agents to independently learn subgoal division at the entity level and act in the environment based on the associated entities. The subgoal division is regularized by opponent modeling to avoid subgoal conflicts and promote coordinated strategies. Empirically, EnDi demonstrates the strong generalization ability to unseen games with new dynamics and expresses the superiority over existing methods.","No"

"Revisiting Softmax for Uncertainty Approximation in Text Classification","Andreas Nugaard Holm, Dustin Wright, Isabelle Augenstein",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14037","Uncertainty approximation in text classification is an important area with applications in domain adaptation and interpretability. The most widely used uncertainty approximation method is Monte Carlo Dropout, which is computationally expensive as it requires multiple forward passes through the model. A cheaper alternative is to simply use a softmax to estimate model uncertainty. However, prior work has indicated that the softmax can generate overconfident uncertainty estimates and can thus be tricked into producing incorrect predictions. In this paper, we perform a thorough empirical analysis of both methods on five datasets with two base neural architectures in order to reveal insight into the trade-offs between the two. We compare the methods' uncertainty approximations and downstream text classification performance, while weighing their performance against their computational complexity as a cost-benefit analysis, by measuring runtime (cost) and the downstream performance (benefit). We find that, while Monte Carlo produces the best uncertainty approximations, using a simple softmax leads to competitive uncertainty estimation for text classification at a much lower computational cost, suggesting that softmax can in fact be a sufficient uncertainty estimate when computational resources are a concern.","No"
"Efficient Zero-shot Event Extraction with Context-Definition Alignment","Hongming Zhang, Wenlin Yao, Dong Yu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05156","Event extraction (EE) is the task of identifying interested event mentions from text. Conventional efforts mainly focus on the supervised setting. However, these supervised models cannot generalize to event types out of the pre-defined ontology. To fill this gap, many efforts have been devoted to the zero-shot EE problem. This paper follows the trend of modeling event-type semantics but moves one step further. We argue that using the static embedding of the event type name might not be enough because a single word could be ambiguous, and we need a sentence to define the type semantics accurately. To model the definition semantics, we use two separate transformer models to project the contextualized event mentions and corresponding definitions into the same embedding space and then minimize their embedding distance via contrastive learning. On top of that, we also propose a warming phase to help the model learn the minor difference between similar definitions. We name our approach Zero-shot Event extraction with Definition (ZED). Experiments on the MAVEN dataset show that our model significantly outperforms all previous zero-shot EE methods with fast inference speed due to the disjoint design. Further experiments also show that ZED can be easily applied to the few-shot setting when the annotation is available and consistently outperforms baseline supervised methods.","No"

However, existing approaches on semantic parsing cannot adapt to both modalities, as they suffer from the exponential growth of the logical form candidates and can hardly generalize to unseen data. In this work, we propose Uni-Parser, a unified semantic parser for question answering (QA) on both KB and DB. We introduce the primitive (relation and entity in KB, and table name, column name and cell value in DB) as an essential element in our framework. The number of primitives grows linearly with the number of retrieved relations in KB and DB, preventing us from dealing with exponential logic form candidates. We leverage the generator to predict final logical forms by altering and composing topranked primitives with different operations (e.g. select, where, count). With sufficiently pruned search space by a contrastive primitive ranker, the generator is empowered to capture the composition of primitives enhancing its generalization ability. We achieve competitive results on multiple KB and DB QA benchmarks more efficiently, especially in the compositional and zero-shot settings.","No"

As a step towards making the VQA task more explainable and interpretable, our method is built upon the SOTA VQA framework by augmenting it with an end-to-end explanation generation module.

In sentiment analysis, input in text data is first converted into a numerical representation. The standard method used to obtain a text representation is the fine-tuned embedding method. However, this method does not pay attention to each word's context in the sentence.

"ADEPT: A DEbiasing PrompT Framework","Ke Yang, Charles Yu, Yi Fung, Manling Li, Heng Ji",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05414","Several works have proven that finetuning is an applicable approach for debiasing contextualized word embeddings. Similarly, discrete prompts with semantic meanings have shown to be effective in debiasing tasks. With unfixed mathematical representation at the token level, continuous prompts usually surpass discrete ones at providing a pre-trained language model (PLM) with additional task-specific information. Despite this, relatively few efforts have been made to debias PLMs by prompt tuning with continuous prompts compared to its discrete counterpart. Furthermore, for most debiasing methods that alter a PLM's original parameters, a major problem is the need to not only decrease the bias in the PLM but also to ensure that the PLM does not lose its representation ability. Finetuning methods typically have a hard time maintaining this balance, as they tend to violently remove meanings of attribute words. In this paper, we propose ADEPT, a method to debias PLMs using prompt tuning while maintaining the delicate balance between removing biases and ensuring representation ability. To achieve this, we propose a new training criterion inspired by manifold learning and equip it with an explicit debiasing term to optimize prompt tuning. In addition, we conduct several experiments with regard to the reliability, quality, and quantity of a previously proposed attribute training corpus in order to obtain a clearer prototype of a certain attribute, which indicates the attribute's position and relative distances to other words on the manifold. We evaluate ADEPT on several widely acknowledged debiasing benchmarks and downstream tasks, and find that it achieves competitive results while maintaining (and in some cases even improving) the PLM's representation ability. We further visualize words' correlation before and after debiasing a PLM, and give some possible explanations for the visible effects.","No"

As condensed structural information memorizing all history information, the dialogue state in the last turn is typically adopted as the input for predicting the current state by DST models. However, these models tend to keep the predicted slot values unchanged, which is defined as state momentum in this paper. Specifically, the models struggle to update slot values that need to be changed and correct wrongly predicted slot values in the last turn. To this end, we propose MoNET to tackle state momentum via noise-enhanced training. First, the previous state of each turn in the training data is noised via replacing some of its slot values. Then, the noised previous state is used as the input to learn to predict the current state, improving the model's ability to update and correct slot values. Furthermore, a contrastive context matching framework is designed to narrow the representation distance between a state and its corresponding noised variant, which reduces the impact of noised state and makes the model better understand the dialogue history. Experimental results on MultiWOZ datasets show that MoNET outperforms previous DST methods. Ablations and analysis verify the effectiveness of MoNET in alleviating state momentum and improving anti-noise ability.","No"

Our findings suggest that better robustness can be achieved by pre-training data augmentation or by training with input space perturbation. However, training with embedding space perturbation significantly improves generalization. A linguistic correlation analysis of neurons of the learned models reveal that the improved generalization is due to `more specialized' neurons.

"Computer-Aided Modelling of the Bilingual Word Indices to the Ninth-Century Uchitel'noe evangelie","Martin Ruskov and Lora Taseva",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05579","The development of bilingual dictionaries to medieval translations presents diverse difficulties. These result from two types of philological circumstances: a) the asymmetry between the source language and the target language; and b) the varying available sources of both the original and translated texts. In particular, the full critical edition of Tihova of Constantine of Preslav's Uchitel'noe evangelie ('Didactic Gospel') gives a relatively good idea of the Old Church Slavonic translation but not of its Greek source text. This is due to the fact that Cramer's edition of the catenae - used as the parallel text in it - is based on several codices whose text does not fully coincide with the Slavonic. This leads to the addition of the newly-discovered parallels from Byzantine manuscripts and John Chrysostom's homilies. Our approach to these issues is a step-wise process with two main goals: a) to facilitate the philological annotation of input data and b) to consider the manifestations of the mentioned challenges, first, separately in order to simplify their resolution, and, then, in their combination. We demonstrate how we model various types of asymmetric translation correlates and the variability resulting from the pluralism of sources. We also demonstrate how all these constructions are being modelled and processed into the final indices. Our approach is designed with generalisation in mind and is intended to be applicable also for other translations from Greek into Old Church Slavonic.","No"

We cast the control structure prediction as a translation task where Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) are translated to P&IDs. To use established transformer-based language translation models, we represent the P&IDs and PFDs as strings using our recently proposed SFILES 2.0 notation. Model training is performed in a transfer learning approach. Firstly, we pre-train our model using generated P&IDs to learn the grammatical structure of the process diagrams.

This method freezes the model parameters and only updates the prefix to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning. Prefix tuning enables researchers and financial practitioners to achieve similar results with much fewer parameters. In this paper, we explore the robustness of prefix tuning when facing noisy data. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning is more robust to noise than prefix tuning -- the latter method faces a significant decrease in performance on most corrupted data sets with increasing noise levels. Furthermore, prefix tuning has high variances in the F1 scores compared to fine-tuning in many corruption methods. We strongly advocate that caution should be carefully taken when applying the state-of-the-art prefix tuning method to noisy data.","No"
"Prompt Learning for Domain Adaptation in Task-Oriented Dialogue","Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar, Christopher Parisien",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05596","Conversation designers continue to face significant obstacles when creating production quality task-oriented dialogue systems. The complexity and cost involved in schema development and data collection is often a major barrier for such designers, limiting their ability to create natural, user-friendly experiences. We frame the classification of user intent as the generation of a canonical form, a lightweight semantic representation using natural language. We show that canonical forms offer a promising alternative to traditional methods for intent classification. By tuning soft prompts for a frozen large language model, we show that canonical forms generalize very well to new, unseen domains in a zero- or few-shot setting. The method is also sample-efficient, reducing the complexity and effort of developing new task-oriented dialogue domains.","No"
"Using contradictions to improve QA systems","Domenic Rosati",9,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05598","Ensuring the safety of question answering (QA) systems is critical for deploying them in biomedical and scientific domains. One approach to improving these systems uses natural language inference (NLI) to determine whether answers are supported, or entailed, by some background context. However, these systems are vulnerable to supporting an answer with a source that is wrong or misleading. Our work proposes a critical approach by selecting answers based on whether they have been contradicted by some background context. We evaluate this system on multiple choice and extractive QA and find that while the contradiction-based systems are competitive with and often better than entailment-only systems, models that incorporate contradiction, entailment, and QA model confidence scores together are the best. Based on this result, we explore unique opportunities for leveraging contradiction-based approaches such for improving interpretability and selecting better answers.","No"
"Moving beyond word lists: towards abstractive topic labels for human-like topics of scientific documents","Domenic Rosati",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05599","Topic models represent groups of documents as a list of words (the topic labels). This work asks whether an alternative approach to topic labeling can be developed that is closer to a natural language description of a topic than a word list. To this end, we present an approach to generating human-like topic labels using abstractive multi-document summarization (MDS). We investigate our approach with an exploratory case study. We model topics in citation sentences in order to understand what further research needs to be done to fully operationalize MDS for topic labeling. Our case study shows that in addition to more human-like topics there are additional advantages to evaluation by using clustering and summarization measures instead of topic model measures. However, we find that there are several developments needed before we can design a well-powered study to evaluate MDS for topic modeling fully. Namely, improving cluster cohesion, improving the factuality and faithfulness of MDS, and increasing the number of documents that might be supported by MDS. We present a number of ideas on how these can be tackled and conclude with some thoughts on how topic modeling can also be used to improve MDS in general.","No"
"An Inclusive Notion of Text","Ilia Kuznetsov, Iryna Gurevych",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05604","Natural language processing researchers develop models of grammar, meaning and human communication based on written text. Due to task and data differences, what is considered text can vary substantially across studies. A conceptual framework for systematically capturing these differences is lacking. We argue that clarity on the notion of text is crucial for reproducible and generalizable NLP. Towards that goal, we propose common terminology to discuss the production and transformation of textual data, and introduce a two-tier taxonomy of linguistic and non-linguistic elements that are available in textual sources and can be used in NLP modeling. We apply this taxonomy to survey existing work that extends the notion of text beyond the conservative language-centered view. We outline key desiderata and challenges of the emerging inclusive approach to text in NLP, and suggest systematic community-level reporting as a crucial next step to consolidate the discussion.","No"

However, past research has shown that not all examples in a dataset are equally important during training. In fact, it is sometimes possible to prune a considerable fraction of the training set while maintaining the test performance. Established on standard vision benchmarks, two gradient-based scoring metrics for finding important examples are GraNd and its estimated version, EL2N. In this work, we employ these two metrics for the first time in NLP. We demonstrate that these metrics need to be computed after at least one epoch of fine-tuning and they are not reliable in early steps. Furthermore, we show that by pruning a small portion of the examples with the highest GraNd/EL2N scores, we can not only preserve the test accuracy, but also surpass it. This paper details adjustments and implementation choices which enable GraNd and EL2N to be applied to NLP.","No"

Having these two sources of knowledge entangled together is a core issue for generative QA models as it is unclear whether the answer stems from the given non-parametric knowledge or not. This unclarity has implications on issues of trust, interpretability and factuality. In this work, we propose a new paradigm in which QA models are trained to disentangle the two sources of knowledge. Using counterfactual data augmentation, we introduce a model that predicts two answers for a given question: one based on given contextual knowledge and one based on parametric knowledge. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset show that this approach improves the performance of QA models by making them more robust to knowledge conflicts between the two knowledge sources, while generating useful disentangled answers.","No"

Existing techniques for controlling the distribution of generated text only work with quantified distributions, which require pre-defined categories, proportions of the distribution, or an existing corpus following the desired distributions. However, many important distributions, such as personal preferences, are unquantified. In this work, we tackle the problem of generating text following arbitrary distributions (quantified and unquantified) by proposing Nano, a few-shot human-in-the-loop training algorithm that continuously learns from human feedback. Nano achieves state-of-the-art results on single topic/attribute as well as quantified distribution control compared to previous works.

Most existing works focus on designing static sampling strategies. However, each corpus may show varying impacts at different NNLM training stages. In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptive multi-corpora training algorithm that dynamically learns and adjusts the sampling probability of each corpus along the training process. The algorithm is robust to corpora sizes and domain relevance. Compared with static sampling strategy baselines, the proposed approach yields remarkable improvement by achieving up to relative 7% and 9% word error rate (WER) reductions on in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation tasks, respectively.","No"

It composes of representation learning and metrics calculation designs. Previous works construct class representations in different ways, varying from mean output embedding to covariance and distributions. However, using embeddings in space lacks expressivity and cannot capture class information robustly, while statistical complex modeling poses difficulty to metric designs. In this work, we use tensor fields (``areas'') to model classes from the geometrical perspective for few-shot learning. We present a simple and effective method, dubbed hypersphere prototypes (HyperProto), where class information is represented by hyperspheres with dynamic sizes with two sets of learnable parameters: the hypersphere's center and the radius. Extending from points to areas, hyperspheres are much more expressive than embeddings. Moreover, it is more convenient to perform metric-based classification with hypersphere prototypes than statistical modeling, as we only need to calculate the distance from a data point to the surface of the hypersphere. Following this idea, we also develop two variants of prototypes under other measurements. Extensive experiments and analysis on few-shot learning tasks across NLP and CV and comparison with 20+ competitive baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","No"

Based on the collected audit logs, research has proposed to search for attack patterns or track the causal dependencies of system events to reveal the attack sequence. However, existing approaches either cannot reveal long-range attack sequences or suffer from the dependency explosion problem due to a lack of focus on attack-relevant parts, and thus are insufficient for investigating complex attacks. To bridge the gap, we propose Zebra, a system that synergistically integrates attack pattern search and causal dependency tracking for efficient attack investigation. With Zebra, security analysts can alternate between search and tracking to reveal the entire attack sequence in a progressive, user-guided manner, while mitigating the dependency explosion problem by prioritizing the attack-relevant parts. To enable this, Zebra provides (1) an expressive and concise domain-specific language, Tstl, for performing various types of search and tracking analyses, and (2) an optimized language execution engine for efficient execution over a big amount of auditing data. Evaluations on a broad set of attack cases demonstrate the effectiveness of Zebra in facilitating a timely attack investigation.","No"

Vo, Kiet Van Nguyen",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05407","Recognizing handwriting images is challenging due to the vast variation in writing style across many people and distinct linguistic aspects of writing languages. In Vietnamese, besides the modern Latin characters, there are accent and letter marks together with characters that draw confusion to state-of-the-art handwriting recognition methods. Moreover, as a low-resource language, there are not many datasets for researching handwriting recognition in Vietnamese, which makes handwriting recognition in this language have a barrier for researchers to approach. Recent works evaluated offline handwriting recognition methods in Vietnamese using images from an online handwriting dataset constructed by connecting pen stroke coordinates without further processing. This approach obviously can not measure the ability of recognition methods effectively, as it is trivial and may be lack of features that are essential in offline handwriting images. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Transferring method to construct a handwriting image dataset that associates crucial natural attributes required for offline handwriting images. Using our method, we provide a first high-quality synthetic dataset which is complex and natural for efficiently evaluating handwriting recognition methods. In addition, we conduct experiments with various state-of-the-art methods to figure out the challenge to reach the solution for handwriting recognition in Vietnamese.","No"

This is an important but under-studied problem related to disinformation and 'fake news' detection, but it addresses the issue at a coarser granularity compared to looking at an individual article or an individual claim. This is useful as it allows to profile entire media outlets in advance. Unlike previous work, which has focused primarily on text (e.g.,~on the text of the articles published by the target website, or on the textual description in their social media profiles or in Wikipedia), here our main focus is on modeling the similarity between media outlets based on the overlap of their audience. This is motivated by homophily considerations, i.e.,~the tendency of people to have connections to people with similar interests, which we extend to media, hypothesizing that similar types of media would be read by similar kinds of users. In particular, we propose GREENER (GRaph nEural nEtwork for News mEdia pRofiling), a model that builds a graph of inter-media connections based on their audience overlap, and then uses graph neural networks to represent each medium. We find that such representations are quite useful for predicting the factuality and the bias of news media outlets, yielding improvements over state-of-the-art results reported on two datasets. When augmented with conventionally used representations obtained from news articles, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and Wikipedia, prediction accuracy is found to improve by 2.5-27 macro-F1 points for the two tasks.","No"

This inability leads to communication gaps which cause difficulties in their daily lives. The usage of assistive devices can help in mitigating these issues and enable the patients to communicate effectively. However, due to lack of large scale studies of linguistic deficits in aphasia, research on such assistive technology is relatively limited. In this work, we present two contributions that aim to re-initiate research and development in this field. Firstly, we propose a model that uses linguistic features from small scale studies on aphasia patients and generates large scale datasets of synthetic aphasic utterances from grammatically correct datasets. We show that the mean length of utterance, the noun/verb ratio, and the simple/complex sentence ratio of our synthetic datasets correspond to the reported features of aphasic speech. Further, we demonstrate how the synthetic datasets may be utilized to develop assistive devices for aphasia patients. The pre-trained T5 transformer is fine-tuned using the generated dataset to suggest 5 corrected sentences given an aphasic utterance as input. We evaluate the efficacy of the T5 model using the BLEU and cosine semantic similarity scores. Affirming results with BLEU score of 0.827/1.00 and semantic similarity of 0.904/1.00 were obtained. These results provide a strong foundation for the concept that a synthetic dataset based on small scale studies on aphasia can be used to develop effective assistive technology.","No"

Machine translation (MT) holds potential to complement the work of human translators by improving both training procedures and their overall efficiency. Literary translation is less constrained than more traditional MT settings since translators must balance meaning equivalence, readability, and critical interpretability in the target language. This property, along with the complex discourse-level context present in literary texts, also makes literary MT more challenging to computationally model and evaluate. To explore this task, we collect a dataset (Par3) of non-English language novels in the public domain, each aligned at the paragraph level to both human and automatic English translations. Using Par3, we discover that expert literary translators prefer reference human translations over machine-translated paragraphs at a rate of 84%, while state-of-the-art automatic MT metrics do not correlate with those preferences. The experts note that MT outputs contain not only mistranslations, but also discourse-disrupting errors and stylistic inconsistencies. To address these problems, we train a post-editing model whose output is preferred over normal MT output at a rate of 69% by experts. We publicly release Par3 at https://github.com/katherinethai/par3/ to spur future research into literary MT.","No"

Writing concisely is challenging, for writers often struggle to revise their drafts. We introduce and formulate revising for concision as a natural language processing task at the sentence level. Revising for concision requires algorithms to use only necessary words to rewrite a sentence while preserving its meaning. The revised sentence should be evaluated according to its word choice, sentence structure, and organization. The revised sentence also needs to fulfil semantic retention and syntactic soundness. To aide these efforts, we curate and make available a benchmark parallel dataset that can depict revising for concision. The dataset contains 536 pairs of sentences before and after revising, and all pairs are collected from college writing centres. We also present and evaluate the approaches to this problem, which may assist researchers in this area.","No"
"Universal Evasion Attacks on Summarization Scoring","Wenchuan Mu and Kwan Hui Lim",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14260","The automatic scoring of summaries is important as it guides the development of summarizers. Scoring is also complex, as it involves multiple aspects such as fluency, grammar, and even textual entailment with the source text. However, summary scoring has not been considered a machine learning task to study its accuracy and robustness. In this study, we place automatic scoring in the context of regression machine learning tasks and perform evasion attacks to explore its robustness. Attack systems predict a non-summary string from each input, and these non-summary strings achieve competitive scores with good summarizers on the most popular metrics: ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore. Attack systems also 'outperform' state-of-the-art summarization methods on ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L, and score the second-highest on METEOR. Furthermore, a BERTScore backdoor is observed: a simple trigger can score higher than any automatic summarization method. The evasion attacks in this work indicate the low robustness of current scoring systems at the system level. We hope that our highlighting of these proposed attacks will facilitate the development of summary scores.","No"
"Similarity between Units of Natural Language: The Transition from Coarse to Fine Estimation","Wenchuan Mu",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14275","Capturing the similarities between human language units is crucial for explaining how humans associate different objects, and therefore its computation has received extensive attention, research, and applications. With the ever-increasing amount of information around us, calculating similarity becomes increasingly complex, especially in many cases, such as legal or medical affairs, measuring similarity requires extra care and precision, as small acts within a language unit can have significant real-world effects. My research goal in this thesis is to develop regression models that account for similarities between language units in a more refined way. Computation of similarity has come a long way, but approaches to debugging the measures are often based on continually fitting human judgment values. To this end, my goal is to develop an algorithm that precisely catches loopholes in a similarity calculation. Furthermore, most methods have vague definitions of the similarities they compute and are often difficult to interpret. The proposed framework addresses both shortcomings. It constantly improves the model through catching different loopholes. In addition, every refinement of the model provides a reasonable explanation. The regression model introduced in this thesis is called progressively refined similarity computation, which combines attack testing with adversarial training. The similarity regression model of this thesis achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling edge cases.","No"

Such task formulation has three limitations: (i) Single domain/dataset. A system is optimized on a particular dataset from a single domain; therefore, the resulting system cannot work well on other datasets; (ii) the model is evaluated on a limited number of unseen topics; (iii) it is assumed that part of the topics has rich annotations, which might be impossible in real-world applications. These drawbacks will lead to an impractical stance detection system that fails to generalize to open domains and open-form topics. This work defines OpenStance: open-domain zero-shot stance detection, aiming to handle stance detection in an open world with neither domain constraints nor topic-specific annotations. The key challenge of OpenStance lies in the open-domain generalization: learning a system with fully unspecific supervision but capable of generalizing to any dataset. To solve OpenStance, we propose to combine indirect supervision, from textual entailment datasets, and weak supervision, from data generated automatically by pre-trained Language Models. Our single system, without any topic-specific supervision, outperforms the supervised method on three popular datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first work that studies stance detection under the open-domain zero-shot setting. All data and code are publicly released.","No"

A challenging problem for VAs in this domain is determining a user's reason or intent for contacting the VA, especially when the intent was unseen or open during the VA's training. One method for handling open intents is adaptive decision boundary (ADB) post-processing, which learns tight decision boundaries from intent representations to separate known and open intents. We propose incorporating two methods for supervised pre-training of intent representations: prefix-tuning and fine-tuning just the last layer of a large language model (LLM). With this proposal, our accuracy is 1.63% - 2.07% higher than the prior state-of-the-art ADB method for open intent classification on the banking77 benchmark amongst others. Notably, we only supplement the original ADB model with 0.1% additional trainable parameters.

"On Robust Incremental Learning over Many Multilingual Steps","Karan Praharaj, Irina Matveeva",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14307","Recent work in incremental learning has introduced diverse approaches to tackle catastrophic forgetting from data augmentation to optimized training regimes. However, most of them focus on very few training steps. We propose a method for robust incremental learning over dozens of fine-tuning steps using data from a variety of languages. We show that a combination of data-augmentation and an optimized training regime allows us to continue improving the model even for as many as fifty training steps. Crucially, our augmentation strategy does not require retaining access to previous training data and is suitable in scenarios with privacy constraints.","No"
"Causal Analysis of Syntactic Agreement Neurons in Multilingual Language Models","Aaron Mueller, Yu Xia, Tal Linzen",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14328","Structural probing work has found evidence for latent syntactic information in pre-trained language models. However, much of this analysis has focused on monolingual models, and analyses of multilingual models have employed correlational methods that are confounded by the choice of probing tasks. In this study, we causally probe multilingual language models (XGLM and multilingual BERT) as well as monolingual BERT-based models across various languages; we do this by performing counterfactual perturbations on neuron activations and observing the effect on models' subject-verb agreement probabilities. We observe where in the model and to what extent syntactic agreement is encoded in each language. We find significant neuron overlap across languages in autoregressive multilingual language models, but not masked language models. We also find two distinct layer-wise effect patterns and two distinct sets of neurons used for syntactic agreement, depending on whether the subject and verb are separated by other tokens. Finally, we find that behavioral analyses of language models are likely underestimating how sensitive masked language models are to syntactic information.","No"

Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that our method produces synthetic data that is competitive in terms of utility with its non-private counterpart and meanwhile provides strong protection against potential privacy leakages.","No"

RoMQA contains clusters of questions that are derived from related constraints mined from the Wikidata knowledge graph. RoMQA evaluates robustness of QA models to varying constraints by measuring worst-case performance within each question cluster. Compared to prior QA datasets, RoMQA has more human-written questions that require reasoning over more evidence text and have, on average, many more correct answers. In addition, human annotators rate RoMQA questions as more natural or likely to be asked by people. We evaluate state-of-the-art large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings, and find that RoMQA is challenging: zero-shot and few-shot models perform similarly to naive baselines, while supervised retrieval methods perform well below gold evidence upper bounds. Moreover, existing models are not robust to variations in question constraints, but can be made more robust by tuning on clusters of related questions. Our results show that RoMQA is a challenging benchmark for large language models, and provides a quantifiable test to build more robust QA methods.","No"

The Monitor Model (Schaeffer and Carl 2013, 2015) integrates horizontal and vertical processes, assuming priming mechanisms underlie horizontal/automatic processes, while vertical/monitoring processes implement consciously accessible control mechanisms. Carl (2021a) argues that priming processes in translation are part of perception-action loops, interpretable in an embodied/enactivist framework. Carl (2022) develops a post-humanist view on translator-technology interaction facilitated by priming mechanisms which enable representationally unmediated translator-environment coupling. I substantiate these claims, arguing that translation priming results in basic, non-representational content.

However, similar methods for transfer learning from monolingual text to code-switched text have not been extensively explored mainly due to the following challenges: (1) Code-switched corpus, unlike monolingual corpus, consists of more than one language and existing methods can't be applied efficiently, (2) Code-switched corpus is usually made of resource-rich and low-resource languages and upon using multilingual pre-trained language models, the final model might bias towards resource-rich language. In this paper, we focus on code-switched sentiment analysis where we have a labelled resource-rich language dataset and unlabelled code-switched data. We propose a framework that takes the distinction between resource-rich and low-resource language into account. Instead of training on the entire code-switched corpus at once, we create buckets based on the fraction of words in the resource-rich language and progressively train from resource-rich language dominated samples to low-resource language dominated samples. Extensive experiments across multiple language pairs demonstrate that progressive training helps low-resource language dominated samples.","No"

Most prior research focuses on modelling conversational contexts with sequential encoding, ignoring the informative interactions between utterances and conversational-specific features for ECEC. In this paper, we investigate the importance of discourse structures in handling utterance interactions and conversationspecific features for ECEC. To this end, we propose a discourse-aware model (DAM) for this task. Concretely, we jointly model ECEC with discourse parsing using a multi-task learning (MTL) framework and explicitly encode discourse structures via gated graph neural network (gated GNN), integrating rich utterance interaction information to our model. In addition, we use gated GNN to further enhance our ECEC model with conversation-specific features. Results on the benchmark corpus show that DAM outperform the state-of-theart (SOTA) systems in the literature. This suggests that the discourse structure may contain a potential link between emotional utterances and their corresponding cause expressions. It also verifies the effectiveness of conversationalspecific features. The codes of this paper will be available on GitHub.","No"

However, it is common knowledge among researchers that a vast number of papers accepted at top NLP venues come from a handful of western countries and (lately) China; whereas, very few papers from Africa and South America get published. Similar disparities are also believed to exist for paper citation counts. In the spirit of 'what we do not measure, we cannot improve', this work asks a series of questions on the relationship between geographical location and publication success (acceptance in top NLP venues and citation impact). We first created a dataset of 70,000 papers from the ACL Anthology, extracted their meta-information, and generated their citation network. We then show that not only are there substantial geographical disparities in paper acceptance and citation but also that these disparities persist even when controlling for a number of variables such as venue of publication and sub-field of NLP. Further, despite some steps taken by the NLP community to improve geographical diversity, we show that the disparity in publication metrics across locations is still on an increasing trend since the early 2000s.

"Residual Learning of Neural Text Generation with $n$-gram Language Model","Huayang Li, Deng Cai, Jin Xu, Taro Watanabe",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14431","$N$-gram language models (LM) have been largely superseded by neural LMs as the latter exhibits better performance. However, we find that $n$-gram models can achieve satisfactory performance on a large proportion of testing cases, indicating they have already captured abundant knowledge of the language with relatively low computational cost. With this observation, we propose to learn a neural LM that fits the residual between an $n$-gram LM and the real-data distribution. The combination of $n$-gram and neural LMs not only allows the neural part to focus on the deeper understanding of language but also provides a flexible way to customize an LM by switching the underlying $n$-gram model without changing the neural model. Experimental results on three typical language tasks (i.e., language modeling, machine translation, and summarization) demonstrate that our approach attains additional performance gains over popular standalone neural models consistently. We also show that our approach allows for effective domain adaptation by simply switching to a domain-specific $n$-gram model, without any extra training.

This segmentation is often overly aggressive, given that people naturally pause to think as they speak. Consequently, segmentation happens mid-sentence, hindering both punctuation and downstream tasks like machine translation for which high-quality segmentation is critical. Model-based segmentation methods that leverage acoustic features are powerful, but without an understanding of the language itself, these approaches are limited. We present a hybrid approach that leverages both acoustic and language information to improve segmentation. Furthermore, we show that including one word as a look-ahead boosts segmentation quality. On average, our models improve segmentation-F0.5 score by 9.8% over baseline. We show that this approach works for multiple languages. For the downstream task of machine translation, it improves the translation BLEU score by an average of 1.05 points.","No"
"Question-Interlocutor Scope Realized Graph Modeling over Key Utterances for Dialogue Reading Comprehension","Jiangnan Li and Mo Yu and Fandong Meng and Zheng Lin and Peng Fu and Weiping Wang and Jie Zhou",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14456","In this work, we focus on dialogue reading comprehension (DRC), a task extracting answer spans for questions from dialogues. Dialogue context modeling in DRC is tricky due to complex speaker information and noisy dialogue context. To solve the two problems, previous research proposes two self-supervised tasks respectively: guessing who a randomly masked speaker is according to the dialogue and predicting which utterance in the dialogue contains the answer. Although these tasks are effective, there are still urging problems: (1) randomly masking speakers regardless of the question cannot map the speaker mentioned in the question to the corresponding speaker in the dialogue, and ignores the speaker-centric nature of utterances. This leads to wrong answer extraction from utterances in unrelated interlocutors' scopes; (2) the single utterance prediction, preferring utterances similar to the question, is limited in finding answer-contained utterances not similar to the question. To alleviate these problems, we first propose a new key utterances extracting method. It performs prediction on the unit formed by several contiguous utterances, which can realize more answer-contained utterances. Based on utterances in the extracted units, we then propose Question-Interlocutor Scope Realized Graph (QuISG) modeling. As a graph constructed on the text of utterances, QuISG additionally involves the question and question-mentioning speaker names as nodes. To realize interlocutor scopes, speakers in the dialogue are connected with the words in their corresponding utterances. Experiments on the benchmarks show that our method can achieve better and competitive results against previous works.","No"
"Bi-Link: Bridging Inductive Link Predictions from Text via Contrastive Learning of Transformers and Prompts","Bohua Peng, Shihao Liang and Mobarakol Islam",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14463","Inductive knowledge graph completion requires models to comprehend the underlying semantics and logic patterns of relations. With the advance of pretrained language models, recent research have designed transformers for link prediction tasks. However, empirical studies show that linearizing triples affects the learning of relational patterns, such as inversion and symmetry. In this paper, we propose Bi-Link, a contrastive learning framework with probabilistic syntax prompts for link predictions. Using grammatical knowledge of BERT, we efficiently search for relational prompts according to learnt syntactical patterns that generalize to large knowledge graphs. To better express symmetric relations, we design a symmetric link prediction model, establishing bidirectional linking between forward prediction and backward prediction. This bidirectional linking accommodates flexible self-ensemble strategies at test time. In our experiments, Bi-Link outperforms recent baselines on link prediction datasets (WN18RR, FB15K-237, and Wikidata5M). Furthermore, we construct Zeshel-Ind as an in-domain inductive entity linking the environment to evaluate Bi-Link. The experimental results demonstrate that our method yields robust representations which can generalize under domain shift.","No"

Within morphology, the labour-intensive work of tagging/glossing data is a serious bottleneck for both NLP and language documentation. Active learning (AL) aims to reduce the cost of data annotation by selecting data that is most informative for improving the model. In this paper, we explore four sampling strategies for the task of morphological inflection using a Transformer model: a pair of oracle experiments where data is chosen based on whether the model already can or cannot inflect the test forms correctly, as well as strategies based on high/low model confidence, entropy, as well as random selection. We investigate the robustness of each strategy across 30 typologically diverse languages. We also perform a more in-depth case study of Nat\'ugu. Our results show a clear benefit to selecting data based on model confidence and entropy. Unsurprisingly, the oracle experiment, where only incorrectly handled forms are chosen for further training, which is presented as a proxy for linguist/language consultant feedback, shows the most improvement. This is followed closely by choosing low-confidence and high-entropy predictions. We also show that despite the conventional wisdom of larger data sets yielding better accuracy, introducing more instances of high-confidence or low-entropy forms, or forms that the model can already inflect correctly, can reduce model performance.","No"

From the kernel estimator perspective, we suggest a new variant of prefix-tuning -- \textit{inducer-tuning}, which shares the exact mechanism as prefix-tuning while leveraging the residual form found in adapter-tuning.

This paper explores the effectivity of several one-tiered and two-tiered embedding architectures in representing Sinhala text in the sentiment analysis domain. With our findings, the two-tiered embedding architecture where the lower-tier consists of a word embedding and the upper-tier consists of a sentence embedding has been proven to perform better than one-tier word embeddings, by achieving a maximum F1 score of 88.04% in contrast to the 83.76% achieved by word embedding models. Furthermore, embeddings in the hyperbolic space are also developed and compared with Euclidean embeddings in terms of performance.

Experimental results show that leveraging these pairs helps (a) T5 generate affirmative interpretations from negations in a previous benchmark, and (b) a RoBERTa-based classifier solve the task of natural language inference.

Recently, some deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results in XMTC tasks. These models commonly predict scores for all labels by a fully connected layer as the last layer of the model. However, such models can't predict a relatively complete and variable-length label subset for each document, because they select positive labels relevant to the document by a fixed threshold or take top k labels in descending order of scores. A less popular type of deep learning models called sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) focus on predicting variable-length positive labels in sequence style. However, the labels in XMTC tasks are essentially an unordered set rather than an ordered sequence, the default order of labels restrains Seq2Seq models in training. To address this limitation in Seq2Seq, we propose an autoregressive sequence-to-set model for XMTC tasks named OTSeq2Set. Our model generates predictions in student-forcing scheme and is trained by a loss function based on bipartite matching which enables permutation-invariance. Meanwhile, we use the optimal transport distance as a measurement to force the model to focus on the closest labels in semantic label space. Experiments show that OTSeq2Set outperforms other competitive baselines on 4 benchmark datasets. Especially, on the Wikipedia dataset with 31k labels, it outperforms the state-of-the-art Seq2Seq method by 16.34% in micro-F1 score.

Therefore, in this work, we propose an interactive evaluation framework for TOD. We first build a goal-oriented user simulator based on pre-trained models and then use the user simulator to interact with the dialogue system to generate dialogues. Besides, we introduce a sentence-level and a session-level score to measure the sentence fluency and session coherence in the interactive evaluation. Experimental results show that RL-based TOD systems trained by our proposed user simulator can achieve nearly 98% inform and success rates in the interactive evaluation of MultiWOZ dataset and the proposed scores measure the response quality besides the inform and success rates.

However, often little or no information about annotators is known, or the set of annotators is small. In this work, we examine a corpus of social media posts about conflict from a set of 13k annotators and 210k judgements of social norms. We provide a novel experimental setup that applies personalization methods to the modeling of annotators and compare their effectiveness for predicting the perception of social norms. We further provide an analysis of performance across subsets of social situations that vary by the closeness of the relationship between parties in conflict, and assess where personalization helps the most.","No"
"Look to the Right: Mitigating Relative Position Bias in Extractive Question Answering","Kazutoshi Shinoda, Saku Sugawara, Akiko Aizawa",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14541","Extractive question answering (QA) models tend to exploit spurious correlations to make predictions when a training set has unintended biases. This tendency results in models not being generalizable to examples where the correlations do not hold. Determining the spurious correlations QA models can exploit is crucial in building generalizable QA models in real-world applications; moreover, a method needs to be developed that prevents these models from learning the spurious correlations even when a training set is biased. In this study, we discovered that the relative position of an answer, which is defined as the relative distance from an answer span to the closest question-context overlap word, can be exploited by QA models as superficial cues for making predictions. Specifically, we find that when the relative positions in a training set are biased, the performance on examples with relative positions unseen during training is significantly degraded. To mitigate the performance degradation for unseen relative positions, we propose an ensemble-based debiasing method that does not require prior knowledge about the distribution of relative positions. We demonstrate that the proposed method mitigates the models' reliance on relative positions using the biased and full SQuAD dataset. We hope that this study can help enhance the generalization ability of QA models in real-world applications.","No"
"A Robust Bias Mitigation Procedure Based on the Stereotype Content Model","Eddie L. Ungless and Amy Rafferty and Hrichika Nag and Bj\'orn Ross",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14552","The Stereotype Content model (SCM) states that we tend to perceive minority groups as cold, incompetent or both. In this paper we adapt existing work to demonstrate that the Stereotype Content model holds for contextualised word embeddings, then use these results to evaluate a fine-tuning process designed to drive a language model away from stereotyped portrayals of minority groups. We find the SCM terms are better able to capture bias than demographic agnostic terms related to pleasantness. Further, we were able to reduce the presence of stereotypes in the model through a simple fine-tuning procedure that required minimal human and computer resources, without harming downstream performance. We present this work as a prototype of a debiasing procedure that aims to remove the need for a priori knowledge of the specifics of bias in the model.","No"
"Multimodal Contrastive Learning via Uni-Modal Coding and Cross-Modal Prediction for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis","Ronghao Lin, Haifeng Hu",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14556","Multimodal representation learning is a challenging task in which previous work mostly focus on either uni-modality pre-training or cross-modality fusion. In fact, we regard modeling multimodal representation as building a skyscraper, where laying stable foundation and designing the main structure are equally essential. The former is like encoding robust uni-modal representation while the later is like integrating interactive information among different modalities, both of which are critical to learning an effective multimodal representation. Recently, contrastive learning has been successfully applied in representation learning, which can be utilized as the pillar of the skyscraper and benefit the model to extract the most important features contained in the multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named MultiModal Contrastive Learning (MMCL) for multimodal representation to capture intra- and inter-modality dynamics simultaneously. Specifically, we devise uni-modal contrastive coding with an efficient uni-modal feature augmentation strategy to filter inherent noise contained in acoustic and visual modality and acquire more robust uni-modality representations. Besides, a pseudo siamese network is presented to predict representation across different modalities, which successfully captures cross-modal dynamics. Moreover, we design two contrastive learning tasks, instance- and sentiment-based contrastive learning, to promote the process of prediction and learn more interactive information related to sentiment. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods.","No"

Task families are a form of task grouping during the pre-finetuning stage to learn common skills, such as reading comprehension. To close this gap, we analyze the influence of multi-task learning strategies using task families for the English abstractive text summarization task. We group tasks into one of three strategies, i.e., sequential, simultaneous, and continual multi-task learning, and evaluate trained models through two downstream tasks. We find that certain combinations of task families (e.g., advanced reading comprehension and natural language inference) positively impact downstream performance. Further, we find that choice and combinations of task families influence downstream performance more than the training scheme, supporting the use of task families for abstractive text summarization.","No"
"A practical method for occupational skills detection in Vietnamese job listings","Viet-Trung Tran, Hai-Nam Cao and Tuan-Dung Cao",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14607","Vietnamese labor market has been under an imbalanced development. The number of university graduates is growing, but so is the unemployment rate. This situation is often caused by the lack of accurate and timely labor market information, which leads to skill miss-matches between worker supply and the actual market demands. To build a data monitoring and analytic platform for the labor market, one of the main challenges is to be able to automatically detect occupational skills from labor-related data, such as resumes and job listings. Traditional approaches rely on existing taxonomy and/or large annotated data to build Named Entity Recognition (NER) models. They are expensive and require huge manual efforts. In this paper, we propose a practical methodology for skill detection in Vietnamese job listings. Rather than viewing the task as a NER task, we consider the task as a ranking problem. We propose a pipeline in which phrases are first extracted and ranked in semantic similarity with the phrases' contexts. Then we employ a final classification to detect skill phrases. We collected three datasets and conducted extensive experiments. The results demonstrated that our methodology achieved better performance than a NER model in scarce datasets.","No"

According to the theory, local coherence of discourse arises from the manner and extent to which successive utterances make reference to the same entities. In this paper, we investigate the connection between centering theory and modern coreference resolution systems. We provide an operationalization of centering and systematically investigate if neural coreference resolvers adhere to the rules of centering theory by defining various discourse metrics and developing a search-based methodology. Our information-theoretic analysis reveals a positive dependence between coreference and centering; but also shows that high-quality neural coreference resolvers may not benefit much from explicitly modeling centering ideas. Our analysis further shows that contextualized embeddings contain much of the coherence information, which helps explain why CT can only provide little gains to modern neural coreference resolvers which make use of pretrained representations. Finally, we discuss factors that contribute to coreference which are not modeled by CT such as world knowledge and recency bias. We formulate a version of CT that also models recency and show that it captures coreference information better compared to vanilla CT.","No"
"Autoregressive Structured Prediction with Language Models","Tianyu Liu, Yuchen Jiang, Nicholas Monath, Ryan Cotterell, Mrinmaya Sachan",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14698","Recent years have seen a paradigm shift in NLP towards using pretrained language models ({PLM}) for a wide range of tasks. However, there are many difficult design decisions to represent structures (e.g. tagged text, coreference chains) in a way such that they can be captured by PLMs. Prior work on structured prediction with PLMs typically flattens the structured output into a sequence, which limits the quality of structural information being learned and leads to inferior performance compared to classic discriminative models. In this work, we describe an approach to model structures as sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner with PLMs, allowing in-structure dependencies to be learned without any loss. Our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art on all the structured prediction tasks we looked at, namely, named entity recognition, end-to-end relation extraction, and coreference resolution.","No"

"Improving Imbalanced Text Classification with Dynamic Curriculum Learning","Xulong Zhang, Jianzong Wang, Ning Cheng, Jing Xiao",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14724","Recent advances in pre-trained language models have improved the performance for text classification tasks. However, little attention is paid to the priority scheduling strategy on the samples during training. Humans acquire knowledge gradually from easy to complex concepts, and the difficulty of the same material can also vary significantly in different learning stages. Inspired by this insights, we proposed a novel self-paced dynamic curriculum learning (SPDCL) method for imbalanced text classification, which evaluates the sample difficulty by both linguistic character and model capacity. Meanwhile, rather than using static curriculum learning as in the existing research, our SPDCL can reorder and resample training data by difficulty criterion with an adaptive from easy to hard pace. The extensive experiments on several classification tasks show the effectiveness of SPDCL strategy, especially for the imbalanced dataset.","No"
"Linguistic-Enhanced Transformer with CTC Embedding for Speech Recognition","Xulong Zhang, Jianzong Wang, Ning Cheng, Mengyuan Zhao, Zhiyong Zhang, Jing Xiao",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14725","The recent emergence of joint CTC-Attention model shows significant improvement in automatic speech recognition (ASR). The improvement largely lies in the modeling of linguistic information by decoder. The decoder joint-optimized with an acoustic encoder renders the language model from ground-truth sequences in an auto-regressive manner during training. However, the training corpus of the decoder is limited to the speech transcriptions, which is far less than the corpus needed to train an acceptable language model. This leads to poor robustness of decoder. To alleviate this problem, we propose linguistic-enhanced transformer, which introduces refined CTC information to decoder during training process, so that the decoder can be more robust. Our experiments on AISHELL-1 speech corpus show that the character error rate (CER) is relatively reduced by up to 7%. We also find that in joint CTC-Attention ASR model, decoder is more sensitive to linguistic information than acoustic information.","No"

We directly compare global-attention and different segmental-attention modeling variants. We develop and compare two separate time-synchronous decoders, one specifically taking the segmental nature into account, yielding further improvements. Using time-synchronous decoding for segmental models is novel and a step towards streaming applications. Our experiments show the importance of a length model to predict the segment boundaries. The final best segmental-attention model using segmental decoding performs better than global-attention, in contrast to other monotonic attention approaches in the literature. Further, we observe that the segmental model generalizes much better to long sequences of up to several minutes.","No"
"ProSiT! Latent Variable Discovery with PROgressive SImilarity Thresholds","Tommaso Fornaciari, Dirk Hovy, Federico Bianchi",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14763","The most common ways to explore latent document dimensions are topic models and clustering methods. However, topic models have several drawbacks: e.g., they require us to choose the number of latent dimensions a priori, and the results are stochastic. Most clustering methods have the same issues and lack flexibility in various ways, such as not accounting for the influence of different topics on single documents, forcing word-descriptors to belong to a single topic (hard-clustering) or necessarily relying on word representations. We propose PROgressive SImilarity Thresholds - ProSiT, a deterministic and interpretable method, agnostic to the input format, that finds the optimal number of latent dimensions and only has two hyper-parameters, which can be set efficiently via grid search. We compare this method with a wide range of topic models and clustering methods on four benchmark data sets. In most setting, ProSiT matches or outperforms the other methods in terms six metrics of topic coherence and distinctiveness, producing replicable, deterministic results.","No"

Mining-based Zero-Shot Learning with Language Models","Mozes van de Kar, Mengzhou Xia, Danqi Chen, Mikel Artetxe",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14803","Masked language models like BERT can perform text classification in a zero-shot fashion by reformulating downstream tasks as text infilling. However, this approach is highly sensitive to the template used to prompt the model, yet practitioners are blind when designing them in strict zero-shot settings. In this paper, we propose an alternative mining-based approach for zero-shot learning. Instead of prompting language models, we use regular expressions to mine labeled examples from unlabeled corpora, which can optionally be filtered through prompting, and used to finetune a pretrained model. Our method is more flexible and interpretable than prompting, and outperforms it on a wide range of tasks when using comparable templates. Our results suggest that the success of prompting can partly be explained by the model being exposed to similar examples during pretraining, which can be directly retrieved through regular expressions.","No"

One key question, for example, is whether a given biomedical mechanism is supported by experimental evidence. This can be seen as an NLI problem but there are no directly usable datasets to address this. The main challenge is that manually creating informative negative examples for this task is difficult and expensive. We introduce a novel semi-supervised procedure that bootstraps an NLI dataset from existing biomedical dataset that pairs mechanisms with experimental evidence in abstracts. We generate a range of negative examples using nine strategies that manipulate the structure of the underlying mechanisms both with rules, e.g., flip the roles of the entities in the interaction, and, more importantly, as perturbations via logical constraints in a neuro-logical decoding system. We use this procedure to create a novel dataset for NLI in the biomedical domain, called BioNLI and benchmark two state-of-the-art biomedical classifiers. The best result we obtain is around mid 70s in F1, suggesting the difficulty of the task. Critically, the performance on the different classes of negative examples varies widely, from 97% F1 on the simple role change negative examples, to barely better than chance on the negative examples generated using neuro-logic decoding.","No"

However, their ability to systematically assess and assure the quality of this provenance, most crucially whether it properly supports the graph's information, relies mainly on manual processes that do not scale with size. ProVe aims at remedying this, consisting of a pipelined approach that automatically verifies whether a Knowledge Graph triple is supported by text extracted from its documented provenance. ProVe is intended to assist information curators and consists of four main steps involving rule-based methods and machine learning models: text extraction, triple verbalisation, sentence selection, and claim verification. ProVe is evaluated on a Wikidata dataset, achieving promising results overall and excellent performance on the binary classification task of detecting support from provenance, with 87.5% accuracy and 82.9% F1-macro on text-rich sources.

Recently, they have also garnered interest as a way to train neural networks more efficiently. By relaxing constraints inherent to backpropagation (e.g., symmetric feedforward and feedback weights, sequential updates), these methods enable promising prospects, such as local learning. However, the tradeoffs between different methods in terms of final task performance, convergence speed, and ultimately compute and data requirements are rarely outlined. In this work, we use scaling laws to study the ability of Direct Feedback Alignment~(DFA) to train causal decoder-only Transformers efficiently. Scaling laws provide an overview of the tradeoffs implied by a modeling decision, up to extrapolating how it might transfer to increasingly large models. We find that DFA fails to offer more efficient scaling than backpropagation: there is never a regime for which the degradation in loss incurred by using DFA is worth the potential reduction in compute budget. Our finding comes at variance with previous beliefs in the alternative training methods community, and highlights the need for holistic empirical approaches to better understand modeling decisions.","No"

They have the potential to save time and effort when writing code. However, these systems are currently poorly understood, preventing them from being used optimally. In this paper, we investigate the various input parameters of two language models, and conduct a study to understand if variations of these input parameters (e.g. programming task description and the surrounding context, creativity of the language model, number of generated solutions) can have a significant impact on the quality of the generated programs. We design specific operators for varying input parameters and apply them over two code assistants (Copilot and Codex) and two benchmarks representing algorithmic problems (HumanEval and LeetCode). Our results showed that varying the input parameters can significantly improve the performance of language models.

Building these representations, however, requires expensive manual annotation in the form of images paired with their scene graphs or frames. These formalisms remain limited in the nature of entities and relations they can capture. In this paper, we propose to leverage a widely-used meaning representation in the field of natural language processing, the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), to address these shortcomings. Compared to scene graphs, which largely emphasize spatial relationships, our visual AMR graphs are more linguistically informed, with a focus on higher-level semantic concepts extrapolated from visual input. Moreover, they allow us to generate meta-AMR graphs to unify information contained in multiple image descriptions under one representation. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we demonstrate that we can re-purpose an existing text-to-AMR parser to parse images into AMRs. Our findings point to important future research directions for improved scene understanding.","No"

"Unified Multimodal Model with Unlikelihood Training for Visual Dialog","Zihao Wang, Junli Wang, and Changjun Jiang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13235","The task of visual dialog requires a multimodal chatbot to answer sequential questions from humans about image content. Prior work performs the standard likelihood training for answer generation on the positive instances (involving correct answers). However, the likelihood objective often leads to frequent and dull outputs and fails to exploit the useful knowledge from negative instances (involving incorrect answers). In this paper, we propose a Unified Multimodal Model with UnLikelihood Training, named UniMM-UL, to tackle this problem. First, to improve visual dialog understanding and generation by multi-task learning, our model extends ViLBERT from only supporting answer discrimination to holding both answer discrimination and answer generation seamlessly by different attention masks. Specifically, in order to make the original discriminative model compatible with answer generation, we design novel generative attention masks to implement the autoregressive Masked Language Modeling (autoregressive MLM) task. And to attenuate the adverse effects of the likelihood objective, we exploit unlikelihood training on negative instances to make the model less likely to generate incorrect answers. Then, to utilize dense annotations, we adopt different fine-tuning methods for both generating and discriminating answers, rather than just for discriminating answers as in the prior work. Finally, on the VisDial dataset, our model achieves the best generative results (69.23 NDCG score). And our model also yields comparable discriminative results with the state-of-the-art in both single-model and ensemble settings (75.92 and 76.17 NDCG scores).","No"
"Mask the Correct Tokens: An Embarrassingly Simple Approach for Error Correction","Kai Shen, Yichong Leng, Xu Tan, Siliang Tang, Yuan Zhang, Wenjie Liu, Edward Lin",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13252","Text error correction aims to correct the errors in text sequences such as those typed by humans or generated by speech recognition models. Previous error correction methods usually take the source (incorrect) sentence as encoder input and generate the target (correct) sentence through the decoder. Since the error rate of the incorrect sentence is usually low (e.g., 10\%), the correction model can only learn to correct on limited error tokens but trivially copy on most tokens (correct tokens), which harms the effective training of error correction. In this paper, we argue that the correct tokens should be better utilized to facilitate effective training and then propose a simple yet effective masking strategy to achieve this goal. Specifically, we randomly mask out a part of the correct tokens in the source sentence and let the model learn to not only correct the original error tokens but also predict the masked tokens based on their context information. Our method enjoys several advantages: 1) it alleviates trivial copy; 2) it leverages effective training signals from correct tokens; 3) it is a plug-and-play module and can be applied to different models and tasks. Experiments on spelling error correction and speech recognition error correction on Mandarin datasets and grammar error correction on English datasets with both autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation models show that our method improves the correction accuracy consistently.","No"

Further, we propose a novel technique to infuse lexical information directly into speech representations to improve the domain-specific language information implicitly learned during pre-training.

"SEAT: Stable and Explainable Attention","Lijie Hu, Yixin Liu, Ninghao Liu, Mengdi Huai, Lichao Sun and Di Wang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13290","Currently, attention mechanism becomes a standard fixture in most state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models, not only due to outstanding performance it could gain, but also due to plausible innate explanation for the behaviors of neural architectures it provides, which is notoriously difficult to analyze. However, recent studies show that attention is unstable against randomness and perturbations during training or testing, such as random seeds and slight perturbation of embedding vectors, which impedes it from becoming a faithful explanation tool. Thus, a natural question is whether we can find some substitute of the current attention which is more stable and could keep the most important characteristics on explanation and prediction of attention. In this paper, to resolve the problem, we provide a first rigorous definition of such alternate namely SEAT (Stable and Explainable Attention). Specifically, a SEAT should has the following three properties: (1) Its prediction distribution is enforced to be close to the distribution based on the vanilla attention; (2) Its top-k indices have large overlaps with those of the vanilla attention; (3) It is robust w.r.t perturbations, i.e., any slight perturbation on SEAT will not change the prediction distribution too much, which implicitly indicates that it is stable to randomness and perturbations. Finally, through intensive experiments on various datasets, we compare our SEAT with other baseline methods using RNN, BiLSTM and BERT architectures via six different evaluation metrics for model interpretation, stability and accuracy. Results show that SEAT is more stable against different perturbations and randomness while also keeps the explainability of attention, which indicates it is a more faithful explanation. Moreover, compared with vanilla attention, there is almost no utility (accuracy) degradation for SEAT.","No"

In response, we introduce SciRepEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for training and evaluating scientific document representations. It includes 25 challenging and realistic tasks, 11 of which are new, across four formats: classification, regression, ranking and search. We then use the benchmark to study and improve the generalization ability of scientific document representation models. We show how state-of-the-art models struggle to generalize across task formats, and that simple multi-task training fails to improve them. However, a new approach that learns multiple embeddings per document, each tailored to a different format, can improve performance.

However, training is just the origin of a model's life-cycle. Real-world deployments of models require further behavioral adaptations as new requirements emerge or shortcomings become known. Typically, in the space of model behaviors, behavior deletion requests are addressed through model retrainings whereas model finetuning is done to address behavior addition requests, both procedures being instances of data-based model intervention. In this work, we present a preliminary study investigating rank-one editing as a direct intervention method for behavior deletion requests in encoder-decoder transformer models. We propose four editing tasks for NMT and show that the proposed editing algorithm achieves high efficacy, while requiring only a single instance of positive example to fix an erroneous (negative) model behavior.","No"

Our experiments in natural language inference show that focal loss has a regularizing impact on the learning process, increasing accuracy on out-of-distribution data, but slightly decreasing performance on in-distribution data. Despite the improved out-of-distribution performance, we demonstrate the shortcomings of focal loss and its inferiority in comparison to the performance of methods such as unbiased focal loss and self-debiasing ensembles.","No"

But idioms and fixed expressions are different such that the literal meaning of the phrases may or may not be consistent with their contextual meaning. Therefore, we explore different ways to combine static and contextual representations for a stronger baseline model.

However, the boundaries and/or contents of open-domain conversations are not clear. To clarify the boundaries of 'openness', we conduct two studies: First, we classify the types of 'speech events' encountered in a chatbot evaluation data set (i.e., Meena by Google) and find that these conversations mainly cover the 'small talk' category and exclude the other speech event categories encountered in real life human-human communication. Second, we conduct a small-scale pilot study to generate online conversations covering a wider range of speech event categories between two humans vs. a human and a state-of-the-art chatbot (i.e., Blender by Facebook). A human evaluation of these generated conversations indicates a preference for human-human conversations, since the human-chatbot conversations lack coherence in most speech event categories. Based on these results, we suggest (a) using the term 'small talk' instead of 'open-domain' for the current chatbots which are not that 'open' in terms of conversational abilities yet, and (b) revising the evaluation methods to test the chatbot conversations against other speech events.","No"

To address this challenge we introduce PyTAIL, a python library, which allows a human in the loop approach to actively train NLP models. PyTAIL enhances generic active learning, which only suggests new instances to label by also suggesting new features like rules and lexicons to label. Furthermore, PyTAIL is flexible enough for users to accept, reject, or update rules and lexicons as the model is being trained. Finally, we simulate the performance of PyTAIL on existing social media benchmark datasets for text classification. We compare various active learning strategies on these benchmarks. The model closes the gap with as few as 10% of the training data. Finally, we also highlight the importance of tracking evaluation metric on remaining data (which is not yet merged with active learning) alongside the test dataset. This highlights the effectiveness of the model in accurately annotating the remaining dataset, which is especially suitable for batch processing of large unlabelled corpora.

This study addresses the long-tail challenge by transforming this multi-label classification task into an autoregressive generation task. Specifically, we first introduce a novel pretraining objective to generate free text diagnoses and procedure using the SOAP structure, the medical logic physicians use for note documentation. Second, instead of directly predicting the high dimensional space of ICD codes, our model generates the lower dimension of text descriptions, which then infer ICD codes.

Pre-training is usually independent of the downstream task, and previous works have shown that this pre-training alone might not be sufficient to capture the task-specific nuances. We propose a way to tailor a pre-trained BERT model for the downstream task via task-specific masking before the standard supervised fine-tuning. For this, a word list is first collected specific to the task. For example, if the task is sentiment classification, we collect a small sample of words representing both positive and negative sentiments. Next, a word's importance for the task, called the word's task score, is measured using the word list. Each word is then assigned a probability of masking based on its task score. We experiment with different masking functions that assign the probability of masking based on the word's task score. The BERT model is further trained on MLM objective, where masking is done using the above strategy. Following this standard supervised fine-tuning is done for different downstream tasks. Results on these tasks show that the selective masking strategy outperforms random masking, indicating its effectiveness.","No"

To fill this gap, we propose a novel competency-aware NMT by extending conventional NMT with a self-estimator, offering abilities to translate a source sentence and estimate its competency. The self-estimator encodes the information of the decoding procedure and then examines whether it can reconstruct the original semantics of the source sentence. Experimental results on four translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed method not only carries out translation tasks intact but also delivers outstanding performance on quality estimation. Without depending on any reference or annotated data typically required by state-of-the-art metric and quality estimation methods, our model yields an even higher correlation with human quality judgments than a variety of aforementioned methods, such as BLEURT, COMET, and BERTScore.

Nevertheless, they insufficiently incorporate the static hierarchical structure containing all senses (defined as global hierarchy), and ignore the hierarchical sense label sequence corresponding to each instance (defined as local hierarchy). For the purpose of sufficiently exploiting global and local hierarchies of senses to learn better discourse relation representations, we propose a novel GLobal and LOcal Hierarchy-aware Contrastive Framework (GLOF), to model two kinds of hierarchies with the aid of contrastive learning.

"Complementary Explanations for Effective In-Context Learning","Xi Ye, Srinivasan Iyer, Asli Celikyilmaz, Ves Stoyanov, Greg Durrett, Ramakanth Pasunuru",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13892","Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in learning from explanations in prompts. Yet, there has been limited understanding of what makes explanations effective for in-context learning. This work aims to better understand the mechanisms by which explanations are used for in-context learning. We first study the impact of two different factors on prompting performance when using explanations: the computation trace (the way the solution is decomposed) and the natural language of the prompt. By perturbing explanations on three controlled tasks, we show that both factors contribute to the effectiveness of explanations, indicating that LLMs do faithfully follow the explanations to some extent. We further study how to form maximally effective sets of explanations for solving a given test query. We find that LLMs can benefit from the complementarity of the explanation set as they are able to fuse different reasoning specified by individual exemplars in prompts. Additionally, having relevant exemplars also contributes to more effective prompts. Therefore, we propose a maximal-marginal-relevance-based exemplar selection approach for constructing exemplar sets that are both relevant as well as complementary, which successfully improves the in-context learning performance across three real-world tasks on multiple LLMs.","No"
"MUSIED: A Benchmark for Event Detection from Multi-Source Heterogeneous Informal Texts","Xiangyu Xi, Jianwei Lv, Shuaipeng Liu, Wei Ye, Fan Yang and Guanglu Wan",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13896","Event detection (ED) identifies and classifies event triggers from unstructured texts, serving as a fundamental task for information extraction. Despite the remarkable progress achieved in the past several years, most research efforts focus on detecting events from formal texts (e.g., news articles, Wikipedia documents, financial announcements). Moreover, the texts in each dataset are either from a single source or multiple yet relatively homogeneous sources. With massive amounts of user-generated text accumulating on the Web and inside enterprises, identifying meaningful events in these informal texts, usually from multiple heterogeneous sources, has become a problem of significant practical value. As a pioneering exploration that expands event detection to the scenarios involving informal and heterogeneous texts, we propose a new large-scale Chinese event detection dataset based on user reviews, text conversations, and phone conversations in a leading e-commerce platform for food service. We carefully investigate the proposed dataset's textual informality and multi-source heterogeneity characteristics by inspecting data samples quantitatively and qualitatively. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art event detection methods verify the unique challenges posed by these characteristics, indicating that multi-source informal event detection remains an open problem and requires further efforts.

Building language models approach achieves good results in one language and it can be applied to multiple NLP task such as classification, summarization, generation and etc as an out of box model. Among all the of the classical approaches used in NLP, the masked language modeling is the most used. In general, the only requirement to build a language model is presence of the large corpus of textual data. Text classification engines uses a variety of models from classical and state of art transformer models to classify texts for in order to save costs. Sequence Classifiers are mostly used in the domain of text classification. However Token classifiers also are viable candidate models as well. Sequence Classifiers and Token Classifier both tend to improve the classification predictions due to the capturing the context information differently. This work aims to compare the performance of Sequence Classifier and Token Classifiers and evaluate each model on the same set of data. In this work, we are using a pre-trained model as the base model and Token Classifier and Sequence Classier heads results of these two scoring paradigms with be compared..","No"

Previous AI research has shown the importance of fundamental and indispensable knowledge of actions, i.e., preconditions and effects. However, traditional methods rely on logical formalization which hinders practical applications. With recent transformer-based language models (LMs), reasoning over text is desirable and seemingly feasible, leading to the question of whether LMs can effectively and efficiently learn to solve RAC problems. We propose four essential RAC tasks as a comprehensive textual benchmark and generate problems in a way that minimizes the influence of other linguistic requirements (e.g., grounding) to focus on RAC. The resulting benchmark, TRAC, encompassing problems of various complexities, facilitates a more granular evaluation of LMs, precisely targeting the structural generalization ability much needed for RAC. Experiments with three high-performing transformers indicates that additional efforts are needed to tackle challenges raised by TRAC.","No"
"Exposure and Emergence in Usage-Based Grammar: Computational Experiments in 35 Languages","Jonathan Dunn",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14160","This paper uses computational experiments to explore the role of exposure in the emergence of construction grammars. While usage-based grammars are hypothesized to depend on a learner's exposure to actual language use, the mechanisms of such exposure have only been studied in a few constructions in isolation. This paper experiments with (i) the growth rate of the constructicon, (ii) the convergence rate of grammars exposed to independent registers, and (iii) the rate at which constructions are forgotten when they have not been recently observed. These experiments show that the lexicon grows more quickly than the grammar and that the growth rate of the grammar is not dependent on the growth rate of the lexicon. At the same time, register-specific grammars converge onto more similar constructions as the amount of exposure increases. This means that the influence of specific registers becomes less important as exposure increases. Finally, the rate at which constructions are forgotten when they have not been recently observed mirrors the growth rate of the constructicon. This paper thus presents a computational model of usage-based grammar that includes both the emergence and the unentrenchment of constructions.","No"

To train this skill, previous research has used a conversational agent that propose specific cues to prompt children's curiosity during learning. Despite showing pedagogical efficiency, this method is still limited since it relies on generating the said prompts by hand for each educational resource, which can be a very long and costly process. In this context, we leverage the advances in the natural language processing field and explore using a large language model (GPT-3) to automate the generation of this agent's curiosity-prompting cues to help children ask more and deeper questions. We then used this study to investigate a different curiosity-prompting behavior for the agent. The study was conducted with 75 students aged between 9 and 10. They either interacted with a hand-crafted conversational agent that proposes 'closed' manually-extracted cues leading to predefined questions, a GPT-3-driven one that proposes the same type of cues, or a GPT-3-driven one that proposes 'open' cues that can lead to several possible questions. Results showed a similar question-asking performance between children who had the two 'closed' agents, but a significantly better one for participants with the 'open' agent. Our first results suggest the validity of using GPT-3 to facilitate the implementation of curiosity-stimulating learning technologies. In a second step, we also show that GPT-3 can be efficient in proposing the relevant open cues that leave children with more autonomy to express their curiosity.","No"

It is becoming essential to develop fake news detection technologies. While substantial work has been done in this direction, one of the limitations of the current approaches is that these models are focused only on one language and do not use multilingual information. In this work, we propose Multiverse -- a new feature based on multilingual evidence that can be used for fake news detection and improve existing approaches. The hypothesis of the usage of cross-lingual evidence as a feature for fake news detection is confirmed, firstly, by manual experiment based on a set of known true and fake news. After that, we compared our fake news classification system based on the proposed feature with several baselines on two multi-domain datasets of general-topic news and one fake COVID-19 news dataset showing that in additional combination with linguistic features it yields significant improvements.","No"
"On the Effect of Anticipation on Reading Times","Tiago Pimentel, Clara Meister, Ethan G. Wilcox, Roger Levy, Ryan Cotterell",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14301","Over the past two decades, numerous studies have demonstrated how less predictable (i.e. higher surprisal) words take more time to read. In general, these previous studies implicitly assumed the reading process to be purely responsive: readers observe a new word and allocate time to read it as required. These results, however, are also compatible with a reading time that is anticipatory: readers could, e.g., allocate time to a future word based on their expectation about it. In this work, we examine the anticipatory nature of reading by looking at how people's predictions about upcoming material influence reading times. Specifically, we test anticipation by looking at the effects of surprisal and contextual entropy on four reading-time datasets: two self-paced and two eye-tracking. In three of four datasets tested, we find that the entropy predicts reading times as well as (or better than) the surprisal. We then hypothesise four cognitive mechanisms through which the contextual entropy could impact RTs -- three of which we design experiments to analyse. Overall, our results support a view of reading that is both anticipatory and responsive.","No"

Kevin Zhou, Li Xiao",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13229","Fast screening and diagnosis are critical in COVID-19 patient treatment. In addition to the gold standard RT-PCR, radiological imaging like X-ray and CT also works as an important means in patient screening and follow-up. However, due to the excessive number of patients, writing reports becomes a heavy burden for radiologists. To reduce the workload of radiologists, we propose DeltaNet to generate medical reports automatically. Different from typical image captioning approaches that generate reports with an encoder and a decoder, DeltaNet applies a conditional generation process. In particular, given a medical image, DeltaNet employs three steps to generate a report: 1) first retrieving related medical reports, i.e., the historical reports from the same or similar patients; 2) then comparing retrieved images and current image to find the differences; 3) finally generating a new report to accommodate identified differences based on the conditional report. We evaluate DeltaNet on a COVID-19 dataset, where DeltaNet outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Besides COVID-19, the proposed DeltaNet can be applied to other diseases as well. We validate its generalization capabilities on the public IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets for chest-related diseases. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/LX-doctorAI1/DeltaNet}.","No"

For this purpose, inspired by the success of masked language modeling (MLM) tasks in the NLP pre-training area, numerous masked modeling tasks have been proposed for VLP to further promote cross-modal interactions. The core idea of previous masked modeling tasks is to focus on reconstructing the masked tokens based on visible context for learning local-to-local alignment. However, most of them pay little attention to the global semantic features generated for the masked data, resulting in the limited cross-modal alignment ability of global representations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Semantic Completion Learning (SCL) task, complementary to existing masked modeling tasks, to facilitate global-to-local alignment. Specifically, the SCL task complements the missing semantics of masked data by capturing the corresponding information from the other modality, promoting learning more representative global features which have a great impact on the performance of downstream tasks. Moreover, we present a flexible vision encoder, which enables our model to perform image-text and video-text multimodal tasks simultaneously. Experimental results show that our proposed method obtains state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language benchmarks, such as visual question answering, image-text retrieval, and video-text retrieval.","No"

To achieve this goal, we propose the first method for animating a text written in HamNoSys, a lexical Sign language notation, into signed pose sequences. As HamNoSys is universal, our proposed method offers a generic solution invariant to the target Sign language. Our method gradually generates pose predictions using transformer encoders that create meaningful representations of the text and poses while considering their spatial and temporal information. We use weak supervision for the training process and show that our method succeeds in learning from partial and inaccurate data. Additionally, we offer a new distance measurement for pose sequences, normalized Dynamic Time Warping (nDTW), based on DTW over normalized keypoints trajectories, and validate its correctness using AUTSL, a large-scale Sign language dataset. We show that it measures the distance between pose sequences more accurately than existing measurements and use it to assess the quality of our generated pose sequences. Code for the data pre-processing, the model, and the distance measurement is publicly released for future research.","No"
"On the Linguistic and Computational Requirements for Creating Face-to-Face Multimodal Human-Machine Interaction","Jo\~ao Ranhel and Cacilda Vilela de Lima",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13804","In this study, conversations between humans and avatars are linguistically, organizationally, and structurally analyzed, focusing on what is necessary for creating face-to-face multimodal interfaces for machines. We videorecorded thirty-four human-avatar interactions, performed complete linguistic microanalysis on video excerpts, and marked all the occurrences of multimodal actions and events. Statistical inferences were applied to data, allowing us to comprehend not only how often multimodal actions occur but also how multimodal events are distributed between the speaker (emitter) and the listener (recipient). We also observed the distribution of multimodal occurrences for each modality. The data show evidence that double-loop feedback is established during a face-to-face conversation. This led us to propose that knowledge from Conversation Analysis (CA), cognitive science, and Theory of Mind (ToM), among others, should be incorporated into the ones used for describing human-machine multimodal interactions. Face-to-face interfaces require an additional control layer to the multimodal fusion layer. This layer has to organize the flow of conversation, integrate the social context into the interaction, as well as make plans concerning 'what' and 'how' to progress on the interaction. This higher level is best understood if we incorporate insights from CA and ToM into the interface system.","No"

However, it is still challenging to adapt CLIP to compositional image and text matching -- a more challenging image and matching mask requiring the model understanding of compositional word concepts and visual components. Towards better compositional generalization in zero-shot image and text matching, in this paper, we study the problem from a causal perspective: the erroneous semantics of individual entities are essentially confounders that cause the matching failure. Therefore, we propose a novel training-free compositional CLIP model (ComCLIP). ComCLIP disentangles input images into subjects, objects, and action sub-images and composes CLIP's vision encoder and text encoder to perform evolving matching over compositional text embedding and sub-image embeddings. In this way, ComCLIP can mitigate spurious correlations introduced by the pretrained CLIP models and dynamically assess the contribution of each entity when performing image and text matching. Experiments on compositional image-text matching on SVO and ComVG and general image-text retrieval on Flickr8K demonstrate the effectiveness of our plug-and-play method, which boosts the zero-shot inference ability of CLIP even without further training or fine-tuning of CLIP.","No"

"Picking on the Same Person: Does Algorithmic Monoculture lead to Outcome Homogenization?","Rishi Bommasani, Kathleen A. Creel, Ananya Kumar, Dan Jurafsky, Percy Liang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13972","As the scope of machine learning broadens, we observe a recurring theme of algorithmic monoculture: the same systems, or systems that share components (e.g. training data), are deployed by multiple decision-makers. While sharing offers clear advantages (e.g. amortizing costs), does it bear risks? We introduce and formalize one such risk, outcome homogenization: the extent to which particular individuals or groups experience negative outcomes from all decision-makers. If the same individuals or groups exclusively experience undesirable outcomes, this may institutionalize systemic exclusion and reinscribe social hierarchy. To relate algorithmic monoculture and outcome homogenization, we propose the component-sharing hypothesis: if decision-makers share components like training data or specific models, then they will produce more homogeneous outcomes. We test this hypothesis on algorithmic fairness benchmarks, demonstrating that sharing training data reliably exacerbates homogenization, with individual-level effects generally exceeding group-level effects. Further, given the dominant paradigm in AI of foundation models, i.e. models that can be adapted for myriad downstream tasks, we test whether model sharing homogenizes outcomes across tasks. We observe mixed results: we find that for both vision and language settings, the specific methods for adapting a foundation model significantly influence the degree of outcome homogenization. We conclude with philosophical analyses of and societal challenges for outcome homogenization, with an eye towards implications for deployed machine learning systems.","No"

Differences between these approaches might naturally be expected not just in final-answer errors but also in reasoning errors, which can be difficult to detect and are problematic in many real-world domains such as education. We run the first comprehensive comparison between process- and outcome-based approaches trained on a natural language task, GSM8K. We find that pure outcome-based supervision produces similar final-answer error rates with less label supervision. However, for correct reasoning steps we find it necessary to use process-based supervision or supervision from learned reward models that emulate process-based feedback.

In this paper, we instead propose an alternative training objective in which we learn task-specific embeddings of text: our proposed objective learns embeddings such that all texts that share the same target class label should be close together in the embedding space, while all others should be far apart. This allows us to replace the softmax classifier with a more interpretable k-nearest-neighbor classification approach. In a series of experiments, we show that this yields a number of interesting benefits: (1) The resulting order induced by distances in the embedding space can be used to directly explain classification decisions. (2) This facilitates qualitative inspection of the training data, helping us to better understand the problem space and identify labelling quality issues. (3) The learned distances to some degree generalize to unseen classes, allowing us to incrementally add new classes without retraining the model.

To alleviate these problems, methods like introducing external information, reconstructing the optimization function, and manipulating data samples are proposed, while they primarily focus on avoiding training with CDM, inevitably weakening the model's ability of understanding CDM in human conversations and limiting further improvements in model performance. This paper proposes a Sentence Semantic \textbf{Seg}mentation guided \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder (SegCVAE) method which can model and take advantages of the CDM data.

To mitigate the non-diverse problem brought by many-to-one, SegCVAE segments multiple prominent semantics to enrich the latent variables. Three novel components, Internal Separation, External Guidance, and Semantic Norms, are proposed to achieve SegCVAE.

"A Commonsense-Infused Language-Agnostic Learning Framework for Enhancing Prediction of Political Polarity in Multilingual News Headlines","Swati Swati (1 and 2), Adrian Mladeni\'c Grobelnik (1), Dunja Mladeni\'c (1 and 2), Marko Grobelnik (1) ((1) Jo\v{z}ef Stefan Institute - Ljubljana, (2) Jo\v{z}ef Stefan International Postgraduate School - Ljubljana)",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00298","Predicting the political polarity of news headlines is a challenging task that becomes even more challenging in a multilingual setting with low-resource languages. To deal with this, we propose to utilise the Inferential Commonsense Knowledge via a Translate-Retrieve-Translate strategy to introduce a learning framework. To begin with, we use the method of translation and retrieval to acquire the inferential knowledge in the target language. We then employ an attention mechanism to emphasise important inferences. We finally integrate the attended inferences into a multilingual pre-trained language model for the task of bias prediction. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we present a dataset of over 62.6K multilingual news headlines in five European languages annotated with their respective political polarities. We evaluate several state-of-the-art multilingual pre-trained language models since their performance tends to vary across languages (low/high resource). Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed framework is effective regardless of the models employed. Overall, the best performing model trained with only headlines show 0.90 accuracy and F1, and 0.83 jaccard score. With attended knowledge in our framework, the same model show an increase in 2.2% accuracy and F1, and 3.6% jaccard score. Extending our experiments to individual languages reveals that the models we analyze for Slovenian perform significantly worse than other languages in our dataset. To investigate this, we assess the effect of translation quality on prediction performance. It indicates that the disparity in performance is most likely due to poor translation quality. We release our dataset and scripts at: https://github.com/Swati17293/KG-Multi-Bias for future research. Our framework has the potential to benefit journalists, social scientists, news producers, and consumers.","No"
"Learning to Select from Multiple Options","Jiangshu Du, Wenpeng Yin, Congying Xia, Philip S. Yu",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00301","Many NLP tasks can be regarded as a selection problem from a set of options, such as classification tasks, multi-choice question answering, etc. Textual entailment (TE) has been shown as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach to dealing with those selection problems. TE treats input texts as premises (P), options as hypotheses (H), then handles the selection problem by modeling (P, H) pairwise. Two limitations: first, the pairwise modeling is unaware of other options, which is less intuitive since humans often determine the best options by comparing competing candidates; second, the inference process of pairwise TE is time-consuming, especially when the option space is large. To deal with the two issues, this work first proposes a contextualized TE model (Context-TE) by appending other k options as the context of the current (P, H) modeling. Context-TE is able to learn more reliable decision for the H since it considers various context. Second, we speed up Context-TE by coming up with Parallel-TE, which learns the decisions of multiple options simultaneously. Parallel-TE significantly improves the inference speed while keeping comparable performance with Context-TE. Our methods are evaluated on three tasks (ultra-fine entity typing, intent detection and multi-choice QA) that are typical selection problems with different sizes of options. Experiments show our models set new SOTA performance; particularly, Parallel-TE is faster than the pairwise TE by k times in inference.

"Anger Breeds Controversy: Analyzing Controversy and Emotions on Reddit","Kai Chen, Zihao He, Rong-Ching Chang, Jonathan May, Kristina Lerman",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00339","Emotions play an important role in interpersonal interactions and social conflict, yet their function in the development of controversy and disagreement in online conversations has not been explored. To address this gap, we study controversy on Reddit, a popular network of online discussion forums. We collect discussions from a wide variety of topical forums and use emotion detection to recognize a range of emotions from text, including anger, fear, joy, admiration, etc. Our study has three main findings. First, controversial comments express more anger and less admiration, joy and optimism than non-controversial comments. Second, controversial comments affect emotions of downstream comments in a discussion, usually resulting in long-term increase in anger and a decrease in positive emotions, although the magnitude and direction of emotional change depends on the forum. Finally, we show that emotions help better predict which comments will become controversial. Understanding emotional dynamics of online discussions can help communities to better manage conversations.","No"
"Language Model Pre-training on True Negatives","Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao, Masao Utiyama, Eiichiro Sumita",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00460","Discriminative pre-trained language models (PLMs) learn to predict original texts from intentionally corrupted ones. Taking the former text as positive and the latter as negative samples, the PLM can be trained effectively for contextualized representation. However, the training of such a type of PLMs highly relies on the quality of the automatically constructed samples. Existing PLMs simply treat all corrupted texts as equal negative without any examination, which actually lets the resulting model inevitably suffer from the false negative issue where training is carried out on pseudo-negative data and leads to less efficiency and less robustness in the resulting PLMs. In this work, on the basis of defining the false negative issue in discriminative PLMs that has been ignored for a long time, we design enhanced pre-training methods to counteract false negative predictions and encourage pre-training language models on true negatives by correcting the harmful gradient updates subject to false negative predictions. Experimental results on GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks show that our counter-false-negative pre-training methods indeed bring about better performance together with stronger robustness.","No"

"IRRGN: An Implicit Relational Reasoning Graph Network for Multi-turn Response Selection","Jingcheng Deng, Hengwei Dai, Xuewei Guo, Yuanchen Ju and Wei Peng",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00482","The task of response selection in multi-turn dialogue is to find the best option from all candidates. In order to improve the reasoning ability of the model, previous studies pay more attention to using explicit algorithms to model the dependencies between utterances, which are deterministic, limited and inflexible. In addition, few studies consider differences between the options before and after reasoning. In this paper, we propose an Implicit Relational Reasoning Graph Network to address these issues, which consists of the Utterance Relational Reasoner (URR) and the Option Dual Comparator (ODC). URR aims to implicitly extract dependencies between utterances, as well as utterances and options, and make reasoning with relational graph convolutional networks. ODC focuses on perceiving the difference between the options through dual comparison, which can eliminate the interference of the noise options. Experimental results on two multi-turn dialogue reasoning benchmark datasets MuTual and MuTual+ show that our method significantly improves the baseline of four pretrained language models and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The model surpasses human performance for the first time on the MuTual dataset.","No"

How to construct positive and negative samples correctly and reasonably is the core challenge of contrastive learning. Since it is difficult to construct contrastive objects in multi-label multi-classification tasks, there are few contrastive losses for multi-label multi-classification text classification. In this paper, we propose five contrastive losses for multi-label multi-classification tasks. They are Strict Contrastive Loss (SCL), Intra-label Contrastive Loss (ICL), Jaccard Similarity Contrastive Loss (JSCL), and Jaccard Similarity Probability Contrastive Loss (JSPCL) and Stepwise Label Contrastive Loss (SLCL). We explore the effectiveness of contrastive learning for multi-label multi-classification tasks under different strategies, and provide a set of baseline methods for contrastive learning techniques on multi-label classification tasks. We also perform an interpretability analysis of our approach to show how different contrastive learning methods play their roles. The experimental results in this paper demonstrate that our proposed contrastive losses can bring some improvement for multi-label multi-classification tasks.

CLS has attracted wide research attention due to its practical significance in the multi-lingual world. Though great contributions have been made, existing CLS works typically focus on short documents, such as news articles, short dialogues and guides. Different from these short texts, long documents such as academic articles and business reports usually discuss complicated subjects and consist of thousands of words, making them non-trivial to process and summarize. To promote CLS research on long documents, we construct Perseus, the first long-document CLS dataset which collects about 94K Chinese scientific documents paired with English summaries. The average length of documents in Perseus is more than two thousand tokens. As a preliminary study on long-document CLS, we build and evaluate various CLS baselines, including pipeline and end-to-end methods. Experimental results on Perseus show the superiority of the end-to-end baseline, outperforming the strong pipeline models equipped with sophisticated machine translation systems. Furthermore, to provide a deeper understanding, we manually analyze the model outputs and discuss specific challenges faced by current approaches.

"Embedding generation for text classification of Brazilian Portuguese user reviews: from bag-of-words to transformers","Frederico Dias Souza and Jo\~ao Baptista de Oliveira e Souza Filho",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00587","Text classification is a natural language processing (NLP) task relevant to many commercial applications, like e-commerce and customer service. Naturally, classifying such excerpts accurately often represents a challenge, due to intrinsic language aspects, like irony and nuance. To accomplish this task, one must provide a robust numerical representation for documents, a process known as embedding. Embedding represents a key NLP field nowadays, having faced a significant advance in the last decade, especially after the introduction of the word-to-vector concept and the popularization of Deep Learning models for solving NLP tasks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformer-based Language Models (TLMs). Despite the impressive achievements in this field, the literature coverage regarding generating embeddings for Brazilian Portuguese texts is scarce, especially when considering commercial user reviews. Therefore, this work aims to provide a comprehensive experimental study of embedding approaches targeting a binary sentiment classification of user reviews in Brazilian Portuguese. This study includes from classical (Bag-of-Words) to state-of-the-art (Transformer-based) NLP models. The methods are evaluated with five open-source databases with pre-defined data partitions made available in an open digital repository to encourage reproducibility. The Fine-tuned TLMs achieved the best results for all cases, being followed by the Feature-based TLM, LSTM, and CNN, with alternate ranks, depending on the database under analysis.","No"
"Language models and brain alignment: beyond word-level semantics and prediction","Gabriele Merlin and Mariya Toneva",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00596","Pretrained language models that have been trained to predict the next word over billions of text documents have been shown to also significantly predict brain recordings of people comprehending language. Understanding the reasons behind the observed similarities between language in machines and language in the brain can lead to more insight into both systems. Recent works suggest that the prediction of the next word is a key mechanism that contributes to the alignment between the two. What is not yet understood is whether prediction of the next word is necessary for this observed alignment or simply sufficient, and whether there are other shared mechanisms or information that is similarly important. In this work, we take a first step towards a better understanding via two simple perturbations in a popular pretrained language model. The first perturbation is to improve the model's ability to predict the next word in the specific naturalistic stimulus text that the brain recordings correspond to. We show that this indeed improves the alignment with the brain recordings. However, this improved alignment may also be due to any improved word-level or multi-word level semantics for the specific world that is described by the stimulus narrative. We aim to disentangle the contribution of next word prediction and semantic knowledge via our second perturbation: scrambling the word order at inference time, which reduces the ability to predict the next word, but maintains any newly learned word-level semantics. By comparing the alignment with brain recordings of these differently perturbed models, we show that improvements in alignment with brain recordings are due to more than improvements in next word prediction and word-level semantics.","No"

However, this comes at the cost of increased model parameters. In this work, we propose Adapted Multimodal BERT (AMB), a BERT-based architecture for multimodal tasks that uses a combination of adapter modules and intermediate fusion layers. The adapter adjusts the pretrained language model for the task at hand, while the fusion layers perform task-specific, layer-wise fusion of audio-visual information with textual BERT representations. During the adaptation process the pre-trained language model parameters remain frozen, allowing for fast, parameter-efficient training. In our ablations we see that this approach leads to efficient models, that can outperform their fine-tuned counterparts and are robust to input noise. Our experiments on sentiment analysis with CMU-MOSEI show that AMB outperforms the current state-of-the-art across metrics, with 3.4% relative reduction in the resulting error and 2.1% relative improvement in 7-class classification accuracy.","No"

"Operationalizing Specifications, In Addition to Test Sets for Evaluating Constrained Generative Models","Vikas Raunak, Matt Post and Arul Menezes",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00006","In this work, we present some recommendations on the evaluation of state-of-the-art generative models for constrained generation tasks. The progress on generative models has been rapid in recent years. These large-scale models have had three impacts: firstly, the fluency of generation in both language and vision modalities has rendered common average-case evaluation metrics much less useful in diagnosing system errors. Secondly, the same substrate models now form the basis of a number of applications, driven both by the utility of their representations as well as phenomena such as in-context learning, which raise the abstraction level of interacting with such models. Thirdly, the user expectations around these models and their feted public releases have made the technical challenge of out of domain generalization much less excusable in practice. Subsequently, our evaluation methodologies haven't adapted to these changes. More concretely, while the associated utility and methods of interacting with generative models have expanded, a similar expansion has not been observed in their evaluation practices. In this paper, we argue that the scale of generative models could be exploited to raise the abstraction level at which evaluation itself is conducted and provide recommendations for the same. Our recommendations are based on leveraging specifications as a powerful instrument to evaluate generation quality and are readily applicable to a variety of tasks.","No"
"Distilling Multi-Step Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models into Smaller Models via Semantic Decompositions","Kumar Shridhar, Alessandro Stolfo, Mrinmaya Sachan",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00193","Step-by-step reasoning approaches like chain-of-thought (CoT) have proved to be a very effective technique to induce reasoning capabilities in large language models. However, the success of the CoT approach depends primarily on model size, and often billion parameter-scale models are needed to get CoT to work. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation approach, that leverages the step-by-step CoT reasoning capabilities of larger models and distils these reasoning abilities into smaller models. Our approach Decompositional Distillation learns a semantic decomposition of the original problem into a sequence of subproblems and uses it to train two models: a) a problem decomposer that learns to decompose the complex reasoning problem into a sequence of simpler sub-problems and b) a problem solver that uses the intermediate subproblems to solve the overall problem. On a multi-step math word problem dataset (GSM8K), we boost the performance of GPT-2 variants up to 35% when distilled with our approach compared to CoT. We show that using our approach, it is possible to train a GPT-2-large model (775M) that can outperform a 10X larger GPT-3 (6B) model trained using CoT reasoning. Finally, we also demonstrate that our approach of problem decomposition can also be used as an alternative to CoT prompting, which boosts the GPT-3 performance by 40% compared to CoT prompts.","No"

It is thus important to study the emergence and development of partisan media and political polarization. However, it is challenging to quantitatively infer the ideological positions of media outlets. In this paper, we present a quantitative framework to infer both political bias and content quality of media outlets from text, and we illustrate this framework with empirical experiments with real-world data. We apply a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to a data set of more than 1 million tweets to generate a two-dimensional ideological-bias and content-quality measurement for each tweet. We then infer a ``media-bias chart'' of (bias, quality) coordinates for the media outlets by integrating the (bias, quality) measurements of the tweets of the media outlets. We also apply a variety of baseline machine-learning methods, such as a naive-Bayes method and a support-vector machine (SVM), to infer the bias and quality values for each tweet. All of these baseline approaches are based on a bag-of-words approach. We find that the LSTM-network approach has the best performance of the examined methods.

Due to the multi-modal nature of this task, multiple factors of variation are intertwined, making generalization difficult to analyze. This motivates us to introduce a virtual benchmark, Super-CLEVR, where different factors in VQA domain shifts can be isolated in order that their effects can be studied independently. Four factors are considered: visual complexity, question redundancy, concept distribution and concept compositionality. With controllably generated data, Super-CLEVR enables us to test VQA methods in situations where the test data differs from the training data along each of these axes. We study four existing methods, including two neural symbolic methods NSCL and NSVQA, and two non-symbolic methods FiLM and mDETR; and our proposed method, probabilistic NSVQA (P-NSVQA), which extends NSVQA with uncertainty reasoning.

The main difficulty in speech-text joint pre-training comes from the significant difference between speech and text modalities, especially for Mandarin speech and text. Unlike English and other languages with an alphabetic writing system, Mandarin uses an ideographic writing system where character and sound are not tightly mapped to one another. Therefore, we propose to introduce the phoneme modality into pre-training, which can help capture modality-invariant information between Mandarin speech and text. Specifically, we employ a multi-task learning framework including five self-supervised and supervised tasks with speech and text data. For end-to-end pre-training, we introduce self-supervised speech-to-pseudo-codes (S2C) and phoneme-to-text (P2T) tasks utilizing unlabeled speech and text data, where speech-pseudo-codes pairs and phoneme-text pairs are a supplement to the supervised speech-text pairs. To train the encoder to learn better speech representation, we introduce self-supervised masked speech prediction (MSP) and supervised phoneme prediction (PP) tasks to learn to map speech into phonemes. Besides, we directly add the downstream supervised speech-to-text (S2T) task into the pre-training process, which can further improve the pre-training performance and achieve better recognition results even without fine-tuning. Experiments on AISHELL-1 show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a more than 40% relative improvement compared with other pre-training methods.","No"

In this thesis, we conduct a scientometric analysis to uncover the implicit patterns hidden in CS metadata and to determine the state of CS research. Specifically, we investigate trends of the quantity, impact, and topics for authors, venues, document types (conferences vs. journals), and fields of study (compared to, e.g., medicine). To achieve this we introduce the CS-Insights system, an interactive web application to analyze CS publications with various dashboards, filters, and visualizations. The data underlying this system is the DBLP Discovery Dataset (D3), which contains metadata from 5 million CS publications. Both D3 and CS-Insights are open-access, and CS-Insights can be easily adapted to other datasets in the future. The most interesting findings of our scientometric analysis include that i) there has been a stark increase in publications, authors, and venues in the last two decades, ii) many authors only recently joined the field, iii) the most cited authors and venues focus on computer vision and pattern recognition, while the most productive prefer engineering-related topics, iv) the preference of researchers to publish in conferences over journals dwindles, v) on average, journal articles receive twice as many citations compared to conference papers, but the contrast is much smaller for the most cited conferences and journals, and vi) journals also get more citations in all other investigated fields of study, while only CS and engineering publish more in conferences than journals.","No"

Their effortless amalgamation of viral visuals and compelling messages can have far-reaching implications with proper marketing. Previous research on memes has primarily focused on characterizing their affective spectrum and detecting whether the meme's message insinuates any intended harm, such as hate, offense, racism, etc. However, memes often use abstraction, which can be elusive. Here, we introduce a novel task - EXCLAIM, generating explanations for visual semantic role labeling in memes. To this end, we curate ExHVV, a novel dataset that offers natural language explanations of connotative roles for three types of entities - heroes, villains, and victims, encompassing 4,680 entities present in 3K memes. We also benchmark ExHVV with several strong unimodal and multimodal baselines. Moreover, we posit LUMEN, a novel multimodal, multi-task learning framework that endeavors to address EXCLAIM optimally by jointly learning to predict the correct semantic roles and correspondingly to generate suitable natural language explanations. LUMEN distinctly outperforms the best baseline across 18 standard natural language generation evaluation metrics. Our systematic evaluation and analyses demonstrate that characteristic multimodal cues required for adjudicating semantic roles are also helpful for generating suitable explanations.","No"
"Simplifying and Understanding State Space Models with Diagonal Linear RNNs","Ankit Gupta, Harsh Mehta, Jonathan Berant",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00768","Sequence models based on linear state spaces (SSMs) have recently emerged as a promising choice of architecture for modeling long range dependencies across various modalities. However, they invariably rely on discretization of a continuous state space, which complicates their presentation and understanding. In this work, we dispose of the discretization step, and propose a model based on vanilla Diagonal Linear RNNs ($\mathrm{DLR}$). We empirically show that $\mathrm{DLR}$ is as performant as previously-proposed SSMs in the presence of strong supervision, despite being conceptually much simpler. Moreover, we characterize the expressivity of SSMs (including $\mathrm{DLR}$) and attention-based models via a suite of $13$ synthetic sequence-to-sequence tasks involving interactions over tens of thousands of tokens, ranging from simple operations, such as shifting an input sequence, to detecting co-dependent visual features over long spatial ranges in flattened images. We find that while SSMs report near-perfect performance on tasks that can be modeled via $\textit{few}$ convolutional kernels, they struggle on tasks requiring $\textit{many}$ such kernels and especially when the desired sequence manipulation is $\textit{context-dependent}$. For example, $\mathrm{DLR}$ learns to perfectly shift a $0.5M$-long input by an arbitrary number of positions but fails when the shift size depends on context. Despite these limitations, $\mathrm{DLR}$ reaches high performance on two higher-order reasoning tasks $\mathrm{ListOpsSubTrees}$ and $\mathrm{PathfinderSegmentation}\text{-}\mathrm{256}$ with input lengths $8K$ and $65K$ respectively, and gives encouraging performance on $\mathrm{PathfinderSegmentation}\text{-}\mathrm{512}$ with input length $262K$ for which attention is not a viable choice.","No"
"Assessing the Capacity of Transformer to Abstract Syntactic Representations: A Contrastive Analysis Based on Long-distance Agreement","Bingzhi Li, Guillaume Wisniewski, Beno\^it Crabb\'e",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04523","The long-distance agreement, evidence for syntactic structure, is increasingly used to assess the syntactic generalization of Neural Language Models. Much work has shown that transformers are capable of high accuracy in varied agreement tasks, but the mechanisms by which the models accomplish this behavior are still not well understood. To better understand transformers' internal working, this work contrasts how they handle two superficially similar but theoretically distinct agreement phenomena: subject-verb and object-past participle agreement in French. Using probing and counterfactual analysis methods, our experiments show that i) the agreement task suffers from several confounders which partially question the conclusions drawn so far and ii) transformers handle subject-verb and object-past participle agreements in a way that is consistent with their modeling in theoretical linguistics.","No"
"Explain to me like I am five -- Sentence Simplification Using Transformers","Aman Agarwal",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04595","Sentence simplification aims at making the structure of text easier to read and understand while maintaining its original meaning.

As such, researchers have long attempted to create systems that can generate stories automatically. In recent years, powered by deep learning and massive data resources, automatic story generation has shown significant advances. However, considerable challenges, like the need for global coherence in generated stories, still hamper generative models from reaching the same storytelling ability as human narrators. To tackle these challenges, many studies seek to inject structured knowledge into the generation process, which is referred to as structure knowledge-enhanced story generation. Incorporating external knowledge can enhance the logical coherence among story events, achieve better knowledge grounding, and alleviate over-generalization and repetition problems in stories. This survey provides the latest and comprehensive review of this research field: (i) we present a systematical taxonomy regarding how existing methods integrate structured knowledge into story generation; (ii) we summarize involved story corpora, structured knowledge datasets, and evaluation metrics; (iii) we give multidimensional insights into the challenges of knowledge-enhanced story generation and cast light on promising directions for future study.","No"

Both of these traditional objective functions for the NER problem generally produce adequate performance when the data distribution is balanced and there are sufficient annotated training examples. But since NER is inherently an imbalanced tagging problem, the model performance under the low-resource settings could suffer using these standard objective functions. Based on recent advances in area under the ROC curve (AUC) maximization, we propose to optimize the NER model by maximizing the AUC score. We give evidence that by simply combining two binary-classifiers that maximize the AUC score, significant performance improvement over traditional loss functions is achieved under low-resource NER settings.

This can be useful for identifying and tracking the spread of diseases through social media posts. However, this is a non-trivial task. Here we build on recent studies suggesting that using emotional information may improve upon this task. Our study results in a framework for health mention classification that incorporates affective features. We present two methods, an intermediate task fine-tuning approach (implicit) and a multi-feature fusion approach (explicit) to incorporate emotions into our target task of HMC. We evaluated our approach on 5 HMC-related datasets from different social media platforms including three from Twitter, one from Reddit and another from a combination of social media sources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach results in statistically significant performance gains on HMC tasks. By using the multi-feature fusion approach, we achieve at least a 3% improvement in F1 score over BERT baselines across all datasets. We also show that considering only negative emotions does not significantly affect performance on the HMC task.

However, the current practice of banning such communities from mainstream platforms has unintended consequences: (I) the further radicalization of their members in fringe platforms where they migrate; and (ii) the spillover of harmful content from fringe back onto mainstream platforms. Here, in a large observational study on two banned subreddits, r/The\_Donald and r/fatpeoplehate, we examine how factors associated with the RECRO radicalization framework relate to users' migration decisions. Specifically, we quantify how these factors affect users' decisions to post on fringe platforms and, for those who do, whether they continue posting on the mainstream platform. Our results show that individual-level factors, those relating to the behavior of users, are associated with the decision to post on the fringe platform. Whereas social-level factors, users' connection with the radical community, only affect the propensity to be coactive on both platforms. Overall, our findings pave the way for evidence-based moderation policies, as the decisions to migrate and remain coactive amplify unintended consequences of community bans.","No"

To this end, we propose a complementary tool set including a novel network architecture, a disentanglement loss, and a new editing procedure. Additionally, to measure edit locality, we define a new metric that we call part-wise edit precision. We show that our method outperforms existing SOTA methods by 20% in terms of edit locality, and up to 6.6% in terms of language reference resolution accuracy.

In this work, we improve the compositional skills of T2I models, specifically more accurate attribute binding and better image compositions. To do this, we incorporate linguistic structures with the diffusion guidance process based on the controllable properties of manipulating cross-attention layers in diffusion-based T2I models. We observe that keys and values in cross-attention layers have strong semantic meanings associated with object layouts and content. Therefore, we can better preserve the compositional semantics in the generated image by manipulating the cross-attention representations based on linguistic insights. Built upon Stable Diffusion, a SOTA T2I model, our structured cross-attention design is efficient that requires no additional training samples. We achieve better compositional skills in qualitative and quantitative results, leading to a 5-8% advantage in head-to-head user comparison studies.

However, one MWP problem naturally has multiple solution equations. The training of an MWP solver with (one-problem; one-solution) pairs excludes other correct solutions, and thus limits the generalizability of the MWP solver. One feasible solution to this limitation is to augment multiple solutions to a given problem. However, it is difficult to collect diverse and accurate augment solutions through human efforts. In this paper, we design a new training framework for an MWP solver by introducing a solution buffer and a solution discriminator. The buffer includes solutions generated by an MWP solver to encourage the training data diversity. The discriminator controls the quality of buffered solutions to participate in training. Our framework is flexibly applicable to a wide setting of fully, semi-weakly and weakly supervised training for all Seq2Seq MWP solvers.

Analogical reasoning has long been used in mathematical education, as it enables students to apply common relational structures of mathematical situations to solve new problems. In this paper, we propose to build a novel MWP solver by leveraging analogical MWPs, which advance the solver's generalization ability across different kinds of MWPs. The key idea, named analogy identification, is to associate the analogical MWP pairs in a latent space, i.e., encoding an MWP close to another analogical MWP, while moving away from the non-analogical ones. Moreover, a solution discriminator is integrated into the MWP solver to enhance the association between the representations of MWPs and their true solutions. The evaluation results verify that our proposed analogical learning strategy promotes the performance of MWP-BERT on Math23k over the state-of-the-art model Generate2Rank, with 5 times fewer parameters in the encoder. We also find that our model has a stronger generalization ability in solving difficult MWPs due to the analogical learning from easy MWPs.","No"

Unlike flat entities, entities and their nested entities are more likely to have similar semantic feature representations, drastically increasing difficulties in classifying different entity categories in the few-shot setting. Although prior work has briefly discussed nested structures in the context of few-shot learning, to our best knowledge, this paper is the first one specifically dedicated to studying the few-shot nested NER task. Leveraging contextual dependency to distinguish nested entities, we propose a Biaffine-based Contrastive Learning (BCL) framework. We first design a Biaffine span representation module for learning the contextual span dependency representation for each entity span rather than only learning its semantic representation. We then merge these two representations by the residual connection to distinguish nested entities. Finally, we build a contrastive learning framework to adjust the representation distribution for larger margin boundaries and more generalized domain transfer learning ability. We conducted experimental studies on three English, German, and Russian nested NER datasets. The results show that the BCL outperformed three baseline models on the 1-shot and 5-shot tasks in terms of F1 score.","No"

To cope with the vast search space, existing work usually adopts a two-stage approach: it firstly retrieves a relatively small subgraph related to the question and then performs the reasoning on the subgraph to accurately find the answer entities. Although these two stages are highly related, previous work employs very different technical solutions for developing the retrieval and reasoning models, neglecting their relatedness in task essence. In this paper, we propose UniKGQA, a novel approach for multi-hop KGQA task, by unifying retrieval and reasoning in both model architecture and parameter learning. For model architecture, UniKGQA consists of a semantic matching module based on a pre-trained language model~(PLM) for question-relation semantic matching, and a matching information propagation module to propagate the matching information along the edges on KGs. For parameter learning, we design a shared pre-training task based on question-relation matching for both retrieval and reasoning models, and then propose retrieval- and reasoning-oriented fine-tuning strategies. Compared with previous studies, our approach is more unified, tightly relating the retrieval and reasoning stages.

Since recent ASR models usually have low word error rate (WER), to avoid affecting originally correct tokens, error correction models should only modify incorrect words, and therefore detecting incorrect words is important for error correction. Previous works on error correction either implicitly detect error words through target-source attention or CTC (connectionist temporal classification) loss, or explicitly locate specific deletion/substitution/insertion errors. However, implicit error detection does not provide clear signal about which tokens are incorrect and explicit error detection suffers from low detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose SoftCorrect with a soft error detection mechanism to avoid the limitations of both explicit and implicit error detection. Specifically, we first detect whether a token is correct or not through a probability produced by a dedicatedly designed language model, and then design a constrained CTC loss that only duplicates the detected incorrect tokens to let the decoder focus on the correction of error tokens. Compared with implicit error detection with CTC loss, SoftCorrect provides explicit signal about which words are incorrect and thus does not need to duplicate every token but only incorrect tokens; compared with explicit error detection, SoftCorrect does not detect specific deletion/substitution/insertion errors but just leaves it to CTC loss.

One feasible way is to extract rationales, a subset of inputs, where the performance of prediction drops dramatically when being removed. Though being explainable, most rationale extraction methods for multi-hop fact verification explore the semantic information within each piece of evidence individually, while ignoring the topological information interaction among different pieces of evidence. Intuitively, a faithful rationale bears complementary information being able to extract other rationales through the multi-hop reasoning process. To tackle such disadvantages, we cast explainable multi-hop fact verification as subgraph extraction, which can be solved based on graph convolutional network (GCN) with salience-aware graph learning. In specific, GCN is utilized to incorporate the topological interaction information among multiple pieces of evidence for learning evidence representation. Meanwhile, to alleviate the influence of noisy evidence, the salience-aware graph perturbation is induced into the message passing of GCN. Moreover, the multi-task model with three diagnostic properties of rationale is elaborately designed to improve the quality of an explanation without any explicit annotations. Experimental results on the FEVEROUS benchmark show significant gains over previous state-of-the-art methods for both rationale extraction and fact verification.","No"
"Semantic Role Labeling Meets Definition Modeling: Using Natural Language to Describe Predicate-Argument Structures","Simone Conia and Edoardo Barba and Alessandro Scir\`e and Roberto Navigli",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01094","One of the common traits of past and present approaches for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is that they rely upon discrete labels drawn from a predefined linguistic inventory to classify predicate senses and their arguments. However, we argue this need not be the case. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages Definition Modeling to introduce a generalized formulation of SRL as the task of describing predicate-argument structures using natural language definitions instead of discrete labels. Our novel formulation takes a first step towards placing interpretability and flexibility foremost, and yet our experiments and analyses on PropBank-style and FrameNet-style, dependency-based and span-based SRL also demonstrate that a flexible model with an interpretable output does not necessarily come at the expense of performance.

"Zero-Shot Rumor Detection with Propagation Structure via Prompt Learning","Hongzhan Lin, Pengyao Yi, Jing Ma, Haiyun Jiang, Ziyang Luo, Shuming Shi, Ruifang Liu",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01117","The spread of rumors along with breaking events seriously hinders the truth in the era of social media. Previous studies reveal that due to the lack of annotated resources, rumors presented in minority languages are hard to be detected. Furthermore, the unforeseen breaking events not involved in yesterday's news exacerbate the scarcity of data resources. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot framework based on prompt learning to detect rumors falling in different domains or presented in different languages. More specifically, we firstly represent rumor circulated on social media as diverse propagation threads, then design a hierarchical prompt encoding mechanism to learn language-agnostic contextual representations for both prompts and rumor data. To further enhance domain adaptation, we model the domain-invariant structural features from the propagation threads, to incorporate structural position representations of influential community response. In addition, a new virtual response augmentation method is used to improve model training. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior capacity for detecting rumors at early stages.","No"

"Towards Diverse, Relevant and Coherent Open-Domain Dialogue Generation via Hybrid Latent Variables","Bin Sun, Yitong Li, Fei Mi, Weichao Wang, Yiwei Li, Kan Li",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01145","Conditional variational models, using either continuous or discrete latent variables, are powerful for open-domain dialogue response generation. However, previous works show that continuous latent variables tend to reduce the coherence of generated responses. In this paper, we also found that discrete latent variables have difficulty capturing more diverse expressions. To tackle these problems, we combine the merits of both continuous and discrete latent variables and propose a Hybrid Latent Variable (HLV) method. Specifically, HLV constrains the global semantics of responses through discrete latent variables and enriches responses with continuous latent variables. Thus, we diversify the generated responses while maintaining relevance and coherence. In addition, we propose Conditional Hybrid Variational Transformer (CHVT) to construct and to utilize HLV with transformers for dialogue generation. Through fine-grained symbolic-level semantic information and additive Gaussian mixing, we construct the distribution of continuous variables, prompting the generation of diverse expressions. Meanwhile, to maintain the relevance and coherence, the discrete latent variable is optimized by self-separation training. Experimental results on two dialogue generation datasets (DailyDialog and Opensubtitles) show that CHVT is superior to traditional transformer-based variational mechanism w.r.t. diversity, relevance and coherence metrics. Moreover, we also demonstrate the benefit of applying HLV to fine-tuning two pre-trained dialogue models (PLATO and BART-base).","No"

However, existing work on news summarization almost exclusively focuses on the event details. In this work, we propose the novel task of summarizing the reactions of different speakers, as expressed by their reported statements, to a given event. To this end, we create a new multi-document summarization benchmark, SUMREN, comprising 745 summaries of reported statements from various public figures obtained from 633 news articles discussing 132 events. We propose an automatic silver training data generation approach for our task, which helps smaller models like BART achieve GPT-3 level performance on this task.

Using the same technique, we show that they are scalable to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, where they are capable of replacing LSTMs in the encoder with only minor loss of performance. This suggests that they may be applicable to more involved sequence-to-sequence tasks. Moreover, in contrast to their recurrent non-spiking counterparts, they show robustness to exploding gradient problems without the need to use gates.","No"

In this work, we propose to leverage monolingual data to improve SiMT, which trains a SiMT student on the combination of bilingual data and external monolingual data distilled by Seq-KD. Preliminary experiments on En-Zh and En-Ja news domain corpora demonstrate that monolingual data can significantly improve translation quality (e.g., +3.15 BLEU on En-Zh). Inspired by the behavior of human simultaneous interpreters, we propose a novel monolingual sampling strategy for SiMT, considering both chunk length and monotonicity. Experimental results show that our sampling strategy consistently outperforms the random sampling strategy (and other conventional typical NMT monolingual sampling strategies) by avoiding the key problem of SiMT -- hallucination, and has better scalability.

"Joint Open Knowledge Base Canonicalization and Linking","Yinan Liu and Wei Shen and Yuanfei Wang and Jianyong Wang and Zhenglu Yang and Xiaojie Yuan",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01207","Open Information Extraction (OIE) methods extract a large number of OIE triples (noun phrase, relation phrase, noun phrase) from text, which compose large Open Knowledge Bases (OKBs). However, noun phrases (NPs) and relation phrases (RPs) in OKBs are not canonicalized and often appear in different paraphrased textual variants, which leads to redundant and ambiguous facts. To address this problem, there are two related tasks: OKB canonicalization (i.e., convert NPs and RPs to canonicalized form) and OKB linking (i.e., link NPs and RPs with their corresponding entities and relations in a curated Knowledge Base (e.g., DBPedia). These two tasks are tightly coupled, and one task can benefit significantly from the other. However, they have been studied in isolation so far. In this paper, we explore the task of joint OKB canonicalization and linking for the first time, and propose a novel framework JOCL based on factor graph model to make them reinforce each other. JOCL is flexible enough to combine different signals from both tasks, and able to extend to fit any new signals. A thorough experimental study over two large scale OIE triple data sets shows that our framework outperforms all the baseline methods for the task of OKB canonicalization (OKB linking) in terms of average F1 (accuracy).","No"

An experiment is also done to test whether these models can identify the devices wrongly classified in the FDA database.

"Answer ranking in Community Question Answering: a deep learning approach","Lucas Valentin",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01218","Community Question Answering is the field of computational linguistics that deals with problems derived from the questions and answers posted to websites such as Quora or Stack Overflow. Among some of these problems we find the issue of ranking the multiple answers posted in reply to each question by how informative they are in the attempt to solve the original question. This work tries to advance the state of the art on answer ranking for community Question Answering by proceeding with a deep learning approach. We started off by creating a large data set of questions and answers posted to the Stack Overflow website. We then leveraged the natural language processing capabilities of dense embeddings and LSTM networks to produce a prediction for the accepted answer attribute, and present the answers in a ranked form ordered by how likely they are to be marked as accepted by the question asker. We also produced a set of numerical features to assist with the answer ranking task. These numerical features were either extracted from metadata found in the Stack Overflow posts or derived from the questions and answers texts. We compared the performance of our deep learning models against a set of forest and boosted trees ensemble methods and found that our models could not improve the best baseline results. We speculate that this lack of performance improvement versus the baseline models may be caused by the large number of out of vocabulary words present in the programming code snippets found in the questions and answers text. We conclude that while a deep learning approach may be helpful in answer ranking problems new methods should be developed to assist with the large number of out of vocabulary words present in the programming code snippets","No"
"Subword-Delimited Downsampling for Better Character-Level Translation","Lukas Edman, Antonio Toral, Gertjan van Noord",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01304","Subword-level models have been the dominant paradigm in NLP. However, character-level models have the benefit of seeing each character individually, providing the model with more detailed information that ultimately could lead to better models. Recent works have shown character-level models to be competitive with subword models, but costly in terms of time and computation. Character-level models with a downsampling component alleviate this, but at the cost of quality, particularly for machine translation. This work analyzes the problems of previous downsampling methods and introduces a novel downsampling method which is informed by subwords. This new downsampling method not only outperforms existing downsampling methods, showing that downsampling characters can be done without sacrificing quality, but also leads to promising performance compared to subword models for translation.","No"

Most recent research has focused on understanding and classifying different types of edits in the iterative revision process from human-written text instead of building accurate and robust systems for iterative text revision. In this work, we aim to build an end-to-end text revision system that can iteratively generate helpful edits by explicitly detecting editable spans (where-to-edit) with their corresponding edit intents and then instructing a revision model to revise the detected edit spans. Leveraging datasets from other related text editing NLP tasks, combined with the specification of editable spans, leads our system to more accurately model the process of iterative text refinement, as evidenced by empirical results and human evaluations. Our system significantly outperforms previous baselines on our text revision tasks and other standard text revision tasks, including grammatical error correction, text simplification, sentence fusion, and style transfer.

This begs the question, how to automatically extract such key entities from an image? We propose to use the pre-trained vision and language retrieval model CLIP to localize the visually grounded entities in the news article and then capture the non-visual entities via an open relation extraction model.

Group distributionally robust optimization (G-DRO) can alleviate this problem by minimizing the worst-case loss over a set of pre-defined groups over training data. G-DRO successfully improves performance of the worst-group, where the correlation does not hold. However, G-DRO assumes that the spurious correlations and associated worst groups are known in advance, making it challenging to apply it to new tasks with potentially multiple unknown spurious correlations. We propose AGRO -- Adversarial Group discovery for Distributionally Robust Optimization -- an end-to-end approach that jointly identifies error-prone groups and improves accuracy on them. AGRO equips G-DRO with an adversarial slicing model to find a group assignment for training examples which maximizes worst-case loss over the discovered groups. On the WILDS benchmark, AGRO results in 8% higher model performance on average on known worst-groups, compared to prior group discovery approaches used with G-DRO. AGRO also improves out-of-distribution performance on SST2, QQP, and MS-COCO -- datasets where potential spurious correlations are as yet uncharacterized.

Our MAC aims to reduce video representation's spatial and temporal redundancy in the VidLP model by a mask sampling mechanism to improve pre-training efficiency. Comparing conventional temporal sparse sampling, we propose to randomly mask a high ratio of spatial regions and only feed visible regions into the encoder as sparse spatial sampling. Similarly, we adopt the mask sampling technique for text inputs for consistency. Instead of blindly applying the mask-then-prediction paradigm from MAE, we propose a masked-then-alignment paradigm for efficient video-text alignment. The motivation is that video-text retrieval tasks rely on high-level alignment rather than low-level reconstruction, and multimodal alignment with masked modeling encourages the model to learn a robust and general multimodal representation from incomplete and unstable inputs. Coupling these designs enables efficient end-to-end pre-training: reduce FLOPs (60% off), accelerate pre-training (by 3x), and improve performance. Our MAC achieves state-of-the-art results on various video-text retrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet. Our approach is omnivorous to input modalities.

To create new optimization opportunities for complicated subgraphs, we propose intensive operator fusion, which can effectively stitch multiple complex operators together for better performance. Further, we design a graph partitioning scheme that allows an arbitrary structure for each subgraph while guaranteeing the acyclic property among all generated subgraphs. Additionally, to enable efficient performance tuning on complicated subgraphs, we devise a novel divide-and-conquer tuning mechanism to orchestrate different system components.

Previous ACSR approaches often utilize direct feature concatenation as the main fusion paradigm. However, the asynchronous modalities (\textit{i.e.}, lip, hand shape and hand position) in CS may cause interference for feature concatenation. To address this challenge, we propose a transformer based cross-modal mutual learning framework to prompt multi-modal interaction. Compared with the vanilla self-attention, our model forces modality-specific information of different modalities to pass through a modality-invariant codebook, collating linguistic representations for tokens of each modality. Then the shared linguistic knowledge is used to re-synchronize multi-modal sequences. Moreover, we establish a novel large-scale multi-speaker CS dataset for Mandarin Chinese. To our knowledge, this is the first work on ACSR for Mandarin Chinese. Extensive experiments are conducted for different languages (\textit{i.e.}, Chinese, French, and British English).

Previous studies have introduced applying adapters, which are small lightweight modules commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks. However, such efficient tuning techniques only provide adaptation at the transformer layer, but failed to perform adaptation at the feature extractor. In this paper, we propose CHAPTER, an efficient tuning method specifically designed for SSL speech model, by applying CNN adapters at the feature extractor. Using this method, we can only fine-tune fewer than 5% of parameters per task compared to fully fine-tuning and achieve better and more stable performance. We empirically found that adding CNN adapters to the feature extractor can help the adaptation on emotion and speaker tasks.

Latency, hardware cost, and other efficiency considerations are paramount to the deployment of IR systems in user-facing settings. We propose that IR benchmarks structure their evaluation methodology to include not only metrics of accuracy, but also efficiency considerations such as a query latency and the corresponding cost budget for a reproducible hardware setting.

Here, we introduce cross-stitch bi-encoders, which allow full interaction between the text encoder and the KG encoder via a cross-stitch mechanism. The cross-stitch mechanism allows sharing and updating representations between the two encoders at any layer, with the amount of sharing being dynamically controlled via cross-attention-based gates.

Previously proposed frameworks which conditionally factorize the bilingual task into its constituent monolingual parts are a promising starting point for leveraging monolingual data efficiently. However, these methods require the monolingual modules to perform language segmentation. That is, each monolingual module has to simultaneously detect CS points and transcribe speech segments of one language while ignoring those of other languages -- not a trivial task. We propose to simplify each monolingual module by allowing them to transcribe all speech segments indiscriminately with a monolingual script (i.e. transliteration). This simple modification passes the responsibility of CS point detection to subsequent bilingual modules which determine the final output by considering multiple monolingual transliterations along with external language model information. We apply this transliteration-based approach in an end-to-end differentiable neural network and demonstrate its efficacy for zero-shot CS ASR on Mandarin-English SEAME test sets.","No"

"RQUGE: Reference-Free Metric for Evaluating Question Generation by Answering the Question","Alireza Mohammadshahi and Thomas Scialom and Majid Yazdani and Pouya Yanki and Angela Fan and James Henderson and Marzieh Saeidi",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01482","Existing metrics for evaluating the quality of automatically generated questions such as BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and BLEURT compare the reference and predicted questions, providing a high score when there is a considerable lexical overlap or semantic similarity between the candidate and the reference questions. This approach has two major shortcomings. First, we need expensive human-provided reference questions. Second, it penalises valid questions that may not have high lexical or semantic similarity to the reference questions. In this paper, we propose a new metric, RQUGE, based on the answerability of the candidate question given the context. The metric consists of a question-answering and a span scorer module, in which we use pre-trained models from the existing literature, and therefore, our metric can be used without further training. We show that RQUGE has a higher correlation with human judgment without relying on the reference question. RQUGE is shown to be significantly more robust to several adversarial corruptions. Additionally, we illustrate that we can significantly improve the performance of QA models on out-of-domain datasets by fine-tuning on the synthetic data generated by a question generation model and re-ranked by RQUGE.","No"
"Assessing Resource-Performance Trade-off of Natural Language Models using Data Envelopment Analysis","Zachary Zhou, Alisha Zachariah, Devin Conathan, Jeffery Kline",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01486","Natural language models are often summarized through a high-dimensional set of descriptive metrics including training corpus size, training time, the number of trainable parameters, inference times, and evaluation statistics that assess performance across tasks. The high dimensional nature of these metrics yields challenges with regard to objectively comparing models; in particular it is challenging to assess the trade-off models make between performance and resources (compute time, memory, etc.). We apply Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to this problem of assessing the resource-performance trade-off. DEA is a nonparametric method that measures productive efficiency of abstract units that consume one or more inputs and yield at least one output. We recast natural language models as units suitable for DEA, and we show that DEA can be used to create an effective framework for quantifying model performance and efficiency. A central feature of DEA is that it identifies a subset of models that live on an efficient frontier of performance. DEA is also scalable, having been applied to problems with thousands of units. We report empirical results of DEA applied to 14 different language models that have a variety of architectures, and we show that DEA can be used to identify a subset of models that effectively balance resource demands against performance.","No"
"Continual Learning of Neural Machine Translation within Low Forgetting Risk Regions","Shuhao Gu, Bojie Hu, Yang Feng",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01542","This paper considers continual learning of large-scale pretrained neural machine translation model without accessing the previous training data or introducing model separation. We argue that the widely used regularization-based methods, which perform multi-objective learning with an auxiliary loss, suffer from the misestimate problem and cannot always achieve a good balance between the previous and new tasks. To solve the problem, we propose a two-stage training method based on the local features of the real loss. We first search low forgetting risk regions, where the model can retain the performance on the previous task as the parameters are updated, to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem. Then we can continually train the model within this region only with the new training data to fit the new task. Specifically, we propose two methods to search the low forgetting risk regions, which are based on the curvature of loss and the impacts of the parameters on the model output, respectively. We conduct experiments on domain adaptation and more challenging language adaptation tasks, and the experimental results show that our method can achieve significant improvements compared with several strong baselines.","No"
"PINTO: Faithful Language Reasoning Using Prompt-Generated Rationales","Peifeng Wang, Aaron Chan, Filip Ilievski, Muhao Chen, Xiang Ren",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01562","Neural language models (LMs) have achieved impressive results on various language-based reasoning tasks by utilizing latent knowledge encoded in their own pretrained parameters. To make this reasoning process more explicit, recent works retrieve a rationalizing LM's internal knowledge by training or prompting it to generate free-text rationales, which can be used to guide task predictions made by either the same LM or a separate reasoning LM. However, rationalizing LMs require expensive rationale annotation and/or computation, without any assurance that their generated rationales improve LM task performance or faithfully reflect LM decision-making. In this paper, we propose PINTO, an LM pipeline that rationalizes via prompt-based learning, and learns to faithfully reason over rationales via counterfactual regularization. First, PINTO maps out a suitable reasoning process for the task input by prompting a frozen rationalizing LM to generate a free-text rationale. Second, PINTO's reasoning LM is fine-tuned to solve the task using the generated rationale as context, while regularized to output less confident predictions when the rationale is perturbed. Across four datasets, we show that PINTO significantly improves the generalization ability of the reasoning LM, yielding higher performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets. Also, we find that PINTO's rationales are more faithful to its task predictions than those generated by competitive baselines.","No"

In this paper, we augment these models with an epinet: a small additional network architecture that helps to estimate model uncertainty and form an epistemic neural network (ENN). ENNs are neural networks that can know what they don't know. We show that, using an epinet to prioritize uncertain data, we can fine-tune BERT on GLUE tasks to the same performance while using 2x less data. We also investigate performance in synthetic neural network generative models designed to build understanding. In each setting, using an epinet outperforms heuristic active learning schemes.","No"

Despite the great progress in event extraction, existing studies still depend on roles pre-defined by domain experts. These studies expose obvious weakness when extending to emerging event types or new domains without available roles. Therefore, more attention and effort needs to be devoted to automatically customizing argument roles. In this paper, we define this essential but under-explored task: open-vocabulary argument role prediction. The goal of this task is to infer a set of argument roles for a given event type. We propose a novel unsupervised framework, RolePred for this task. Specifically, we formulate the role prediction problem as an in-filling task and construct prompts for a pre-trained language model to generate candidate roles. By extracting and analyzing the candidate arguments, the event-specific roles are further merged and selected.

Our human study indicates that, though hallucinations exist, large models post the unique advantage of being able to output common sense and summarize facts that cannot be directly retrieved from the search engine. To better exploit such generated knowledge in dialogue generation, we treat the generated knowledge as a noisy knowledge source and propose the posterior-based reweighing as well as the noisy training strategy.

Specifically, we propose a novel zero-shot approach for spelling error correction, which is simple but effective, obtaining a high precision to avoid error accumulation of the pipeline structure. To handle grammatical error correction, we design part-of-speech (POS) features and semantic class features to enhance the neural network model, and propose an auxiliary task to predict the POS sequence of the target sentence. Our proposed framework achieves a 42.11 F0.5 score on CGEC dataset without using any synthetic data or data augmentation methods, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a wide margin of 1.30 points.

"Revisiting Grammatical Error Correction Evaluation and Beyond","Peiyuan Gong, Xuebo Liu, Heyan Huang, Min Zhang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01635","Pretraining-based (PT-based) automatic evaluation metrics (e.g., BERTScore and BARTScore) have been widely used in several sentence generation tasks (e.g., machine translation and text summarization) due to their better correlation with human judgments over traditional overlap-based methods. Although PT-based methods have become the de facto standard for training grammatical error correction (GEC) systems, GEC evaluation still does not benefit from pretrained knowledge. This paper takes the first step towards understanding and improving GEC evaluation with pretraining. We first find that arbitrarily applying PT-based metrics to GEC evaluation brings unsatisfactory correlation results because of the excessive attention to inessential systems outputs (e.g., unchanged parts). To alleviate the limitation, we propose a novel GEC evaluation metric to achieve the best of both worlds, namely PT-M2 which only uses PT-based metrics to score those corrected parts. Experimental results on the CoNLL14 evaluation task show that PT-M2 significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art result of 0.949 Pearson correlation. Further analysis reveals that PT-M2 is robust to evaluate competitive GEC systems. Source code and scripts are freely available at https://github.com/pygongnlp/PT-M2.","No"

"PromptEHR: Conditional Electronic Healthcare Records Generation with Prompt Learning","Zifeng Wang and Jimeng Sun",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01761","Accessing longitudinal multimodal Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) is challenging due to privacy concerns, which hinders the use of ML for healthcare applications. Synthetic EHRs generation bypasses the need to share sensitive real patient records. However, existing methods generate single-modal EHRs by unconditional generation or by longitudinal inference, which falls short of low flexibility and makes unrealistic EHRs. In this work, we propose to formulate EHRs generation as a text-to-text translation task by language models (LMs), which suffices to highly flexible event imputation during generation. We also design prompt learning to control the generation conditioned by numerical and categorical demographic features. We evaluate synthetic EHRs quality by two perplexity measures accounting for their longitudinal pattern (longitudinal imputation perplexity, lpl) and the connections cross modalities (cross-modality imputation perplexity, mpl). Moreover, we utilize two adversaries: membership and attribute inference attacks for privacy-preserving evaluation. Experiments on MIMIC-III data demonstrate the superiority of our methods on realistic EHRs generation (53.1\% decrease of lpl and 45.3\% decrease of mpl on average compared to the best baselines) with low privacy risks.

To dynamically incorporate new topic information, several recent studies have tried to expand (or complete) a topic taxonomy by inserting emerging topics identified in a set of new documents. However, existing methods focus only on frequent terms in documents and the local topic-subtopic relations in a taxonomy, which leads to limited topic term coverage and fails to model the global topic hierarchy. In this work, we propose a novel framework for topic taxonomy expansion, named TopicExpan, which directly generates topic-related terms belonging to new topics. Specifically, TopicExpan leverages the hierarchical relation structure surrounding a new topic and the textual content of an input document for topic term generation. This approach encourages newly-inserted topics to further cover important but less frequent terms as well as to keep their relation consistency within the taxonomy. Experimental results on two real-world text corpora show that TopicExpan significantly outperforms other baseline methods in terms of the quality of output taxonomies.","No"
"Probing Statistical Representations For End-To-End ASR","Anna Ollerenshaw, Md Asif Jalal, Thomas Hain",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01993","End-to-End automatic speech recognition (ASR) models aim to learn a generalised speech representation to perform recognition. In this domain there is little research to analyse internal representation dependencies and their relationship to modelling approaches. This paper investigates cross-domain language model dependencies within transformer architectures using SVCCA and uses these insights to exploit modelling approaches. It was found that specific neural representations within the transformer layers exhibit correlated behaviour which impacts recognition performance. Altogether, this work provides analysis of the modelling approaches affecting contextual dependencies and ASR performance, and can be used to create or adapt better performing End-to-End ASR models and also for downstream tasks.","No"
"Inverse scaling can become U-shaped","Jason Wei, Yi Tay, Quoc V. Le",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02011","Although scaling language models improves performance on a range of tasks, there are apparently some scenarios where scaling hurts performance. For instance, the Inverse Scaling Prize Round 1 identified four ''inverse scaling'' tasks, for which performance gets worse for larger models. These tasks were evaluated on models of up to 280B parameters, trained up to 500 zettaFLOPs of compute. This paper takes a closer look at these four tasks. We evaluate models of up to 540B parameters, trained on five times more compute than those evaluated in the Inverse Scaling Prize. With this increased range of model sizes and training compute, three out of the four tasks exhibit what we call ''U-shaped scaling'' -- performance decreases up to a certain model size, and then increases again up to the largest model evaluated. One hypothesis is that U-shaped scaling occurs when a task comprises a ''true task'' and a ''distractor task''. Medium-size models can do the distractor task, which hurts performance, while only large-enough models can ignore the distractor task and do the true task. The existence of U-shaped scaling implies that inverse scaling may not hold for larger models. Second, we evaluate the inverse scaling tasks using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, in addition to basic prompting without CoT. With CoT prompting, all four tasks show either U-shaped scaling or positive scaling, achieving perfect solve rates on two tasks and several sub-tasks. This suggests that the term 'inverse scaling task' is under-specified -- a given task may be inverse scaling for one prompt but positive or U-shaped scaling for a different prompt.","No"

We then explore the use of variable masking, where the attention masks are sampled from a target distribution at training time, to build models that can work in different configurations. Finally, we investigate how a single configurable model can be used to perform both first pass streaming recognition and second pass acoustic rescoring. Experiments show that chunked masking achieves a better accuracy vs latency trade-off compared to fixed masking, both with and without FastEmit. We also show that variable masking improves the accuracy by up to 8% relative in the acoustic re-scoring scenario.","No"

The latter case is accomplished by furnishing a noisy label-set with the predictions of a separate model, it having been trained in an unsupervised fashion. Results indicate our model eclipses previous state-of-the-art performance in both settings and on both datasets.

Much research on communication emergence uses reinforcement learning (RL) and explores unsituated communication in one-step referential tasks -- the tasks are not temporally interactive and lack time pressures typically present in natural communication. In these settings, agents may successfully learn to communicate, but they do not learn to exchange information concisely -- they tend towards over-communication and an inefficient encoding. Here, we explore situated communication in a multi-step task, where the acting agent has to forgo an environmental action to communicate. Thus, we impose an opportunity cost on communication and mimic the real-world pressure of passing time. We compare communication emergence under this pressure against learning to communicate with a cost on articulation effort, implemented as a per-message penalty (fixed and progressively increasing). We find that while all tested pressures can disincentivise over-communication, situated communication does it most effectively and, unlike the cost on effort, does not negatively impact emergence. Implementing an opportunity cost on communication in a temporally extended environment is a step towards embodiment, and might be a pre-condition for incentivising efficient, human-like communication.","No"

Given an input audio spectrogram we first patchify and project it into an initial temporal resolution and embedding dimension, post which the multiple stages in MAST progressively expand the embedding dimension while reducing the temporal resolution of the input. We use a pyramid structure that allows early layers of MAST operating at a high temporal resolution but low embedding space to model simple low-level acoustic information and deeper temporally coarse layers to model high-level acoustic information with high-dimensional embeddings. We also extend our approach to present a new Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) method called SS-MAST, which calculates a symmetric contrastive loss between latent representations from a student and a teacher encoder. In practice, MAST significantly outperforms AST by an average accuracy of 3.4% across 8 speech and non-speech tasks from the LAPE Benchmark.

Inspired by the recent success of clustering and contrasting learning paradigms for SSL-based speech representation learning, we propose SLICER (Symmetrical Learning of Instance and Cluster-level Efficient Representations), which brings together the best of both clustering and contrasting learning paradigms. We use a symmetric loss between latent representations from student and teacher encoders and simultaneously solve instance and cluster-level contrastive learning tasks.

In order to capture the visual state changes of arguments, we decompose them into changes in pixels within objects, displacements of objects, and interactions among multiple arguments. We further propose Object State Embedding, Object Motion-aware Embedding and Argument Interaction Embedding to encode and track these changes respectively.

However, task performance depends significantly on the quality of the prompt used to steer the model, and most effective prompts have been handcrafted by humans. Inspired by classical program synthesis and the human approach to prompt engineering, we propose Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) for automatic instruction generation and selection. In our method, we treat the instruction as the 'program,' optimized by searching over a pool of instruction candidates proposed by an LLM in order to maximize a chosen score function. To evaluate the quality of the selected instruction, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of another LLM following the selected instruction. Experiments on 24 NLP tasks show that our automatically generated instructions outperform the prior LLM baseline by a large margin and achieve better or comparable performance to the instructions generated by human annotators on 19/24 tasks. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the performance of APE.

We sought to perform topic modeling to identify robust topics of discussion within a large cohort of social work notes. We retrieved a diverse, deidentified corpus of 0.95 million clinical social work notes from 181,644 patients at the University of California, San Francisco. We used word frequency analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling analysis to characterize this corpus and identify potential topics of discussion. Word frequency analysis identified both medical and non-medical terms associated with specific ICD10 chapters. The LDA topic modeling analysis extracted 11 topics related to social determinants of health risk factors including financial status, abuse history, social support, risk of death, and mental health.

Computational linguists have capitalized on this fact to build large language models (LLMs) that acquire co-occurrence-based knowledge from language corpora. LLMs achieve impressive performance on many tasks, but the robustness of their world knowledge has been questioned. Here, we ask: do LLMs acquire generalized knowledge about real-world events? Using curated sets of minimal sentence pairs (n=1215), we tested whether LLMs are more likely to generate plausible event descriptions compared to their implausible counterparts. We found that LLMs systematically distinguish possible and impossible events (The teacher bought the laptop vs. The laptop bought the teacher) but fall short of human performance when distinguishing likely and unlikely events (The nanny tutored the boy vs. The boy tutored the nanny). In follow-up analyses, we show that (i) LLM scores are driven by both plausibility and surface-level sentence features, (ii) LLMs generalize well across syntactic sentence variants (active vs passive) but less well across semantic sentence variants (synonymous sentences), (iii) some, but not all LLM deviations from ground-truth labels align with crowdsourced human judgments, and (iv) explicit event plausibility information emerges in middle LLM layers and remains high thereafter. Overall, our analyses reveal a gap in LLMs' event knowledge, highlighting their limitations as generalized knowledge bases. We conclude by speculating that the differential performance on impossible vs. unlikely events is not a temporary setback but an inherent property of LLMs, reflecting a fundamental difference between linguistic knowledge and world knowledge in intelligent systems.","No"
"Orders Are Unwanted: Dynamic Deep Graph Convolutional Network for Personality Detection","Tao Yang, Jinghao Deng, Xiaojun Quan, Qifan Wang",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01515","Predicting personality traits based on online posts has emerged as an important task in many fields such as social network analysis. One of the challenges of this task is assembling information from various posts into an overall profile for each user. While many previous solutions simply concatenate the posts into a long document and then encode the document by sequential or hierarchical models, they introduce unwarranted orders for the posts, which may mislead the models. In this paper, we propose a dynamic deep graph convolutional network (D-DGCN) to overcome the above limitation. Specifically, we design a learn-to-connect approach that adopts a dynamic multi-hop structure instead of a deterministic structure, and combine it with a DGCN module to automatically learn the connections between posts. The modules of post encoder, learn-to-connect, and DGCN are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner.

Specifically, HRT first autoregressively generates a discontinuous sequence (e.g., make a prediction every $k$ tokens, $k>1$) and then fills in all previously skipped tokens at once in a non-autoregressive manner. Thus, we can easily trade off the translation quality and speed by adjusting $k$. In addition, by integrating other modeling techniques (e.g., sequence-level knowledge distillation and deep-encoder-shallow-decoder layer allocation strategy) and a mass of engineering efforts, HRT improves 80\% inference speed and achieves equivalent translation performance with the same-capacity AT counterpart.

"Modeling Label Correlations for Ultra-Fine Entity Typing with Neural Pairwise Conditional Random Field","Chengyue Jiang, Yong Jiang, Weiqi Wu, Pengjun Xie, Kewei Tu",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01581","Ultra-fine entity typing (UFET) aims to predict a wide range of type phrases that correctly describe the categories of a given entity mention in a sentence. Most recent works infer each entity type independently, ignoring the correlations between types, e.g., when an entity is inferred as a president, it should also be a politician and a leader. To this end, we use an undirected graphical model called pairwise conditional random field (PCRF) to formulate the UFET problem, in which the type variables are not only unarily influenced by the input but also pairwisely relate to all the other type variables. We use various modern backbones for entity typing to compute unary potentials, and derive pairwise potentials from type phrase representations that both capture prior semantic information and facilitate accelerated inference. We use mean-field variational inference for efficient type inference on very large type sets and unfold it as a neural network module to enable end-to-end training. Experiments on UFET show that the Neural-PCRF consistently outperforms its backbones with little cost and results in a competitive performance against cross-encoder based SOTA while being thousands of times faster. We also find Neural- PCRF effective on a widely used fine-grained entity typing dataset with a smaller type set.

To handle this challenge and generate more faithful responses, this paper presents RHO ($\rho$) utilizing the representations of linked entities and relation predicates from a knowledge graph (KG). We propose (1) local knowledge grounding to combine textual embeddings with the corresponding KG embeddings; and (2) global knowledge grounding to equip RHO with multi-hop reasoning abilities via the attention mechanism. In addition, we devise a response re-ranking technique based on walks over KG sub-graphs for better conversational reasoning.

"CoP: Factual Inconsistency Detection by Controlling the Preference","Shuaijie She, Xiang Geng, Shujian Huang, Jiajun Chen",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01611","Abstractive summarization is the process of generating a summary given a document as input. Although significant progress has been made, the factual inconsistency between the document and the generated summary still limits its practical applications. Previous work found that the probabilities assigned by the generation model reflect its preferences for the generated summary, including the preference for factual consistency, and the preference for the language or knowledge prior as well. To separate the preference for factual consistency, we propose an unsupervised framework named CoP by controlling the preference of the generation model with the help of prompt. More specifically, the framework performs an extra inference step in which a text prompt is introduced as an additional input. In this way, another preference is described by the generation probability of this extra inference process. The difference between the above two preferences, i.e. the difference between the probabilities, could be used as measurements for detecting factual inconsistencies. Interestingly, we found that with the properly designed prompt, our framework could evaluate specific preferences and serve as measurements for fine-grained categories of inconsistency, such as entity-related inconsistency, coreference-related inconsistency, etc. Moreover, our framework could also be extended to the supervised setting to learn better prompt from the labeled data as well. Experiments show that our framework achieves new SOTA results on three factual inconsistency detection tasks.","No"

In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-modal Retrieval based framework (MoRe). MoRe contains a text retrieval module and an image-based retrieval module, which retrieve related knowledge of the input text and image in the knowledge corpus respectively. Next, the retrieval results are sent to the textual and visual models respectively for predictions.

These methods perform well in zero-shot and low supervision settings. Compared to standard dense neural embeddings, such interpretable representations may permit analysis and debugging. However, while fine-tuning sparse, interpretable representations improves accuracy on downstream tasks, it destroys the semantics of the dimensions which were enforced in pre-training. Can we maintain the interpretable semantics afforded by IERs while improving predictive performance on downstream tasks? Toward this end, we propose Intermediate enTity-based Sparse Interpretable Representation Learning (ItsIRL). ItsIRL realizes improved performance over prior IERs on biomedical tasks, while maintaining 'interpretability' generally and their ability to support model debugging specifically. The latter is enabled in part by the ability to perform 'counterfactual' fine-grained entity type manipulation, which we explore in this work.

Also, TST models implicitly need to preserve the content while transforming a source sentence into the target style. To tackle these problems, an intermediate representation is often constructed that is devoid of style while still preserving the meaning of the source sentence. In this work, we study the usefulness of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph as the intermediate style agnostic representation. We posit that semantic notations like AMR are a natural choice for an intermediate representation. Hence, we propose T-STAR: a model comprising of two components, text-to-AMR encoder and a AMR-to-text decoder. We propose several modeling improvements to enhance the style agnosticity of the generated AMR. To the best of our knowledge, T-STAR is the first work that uses AMR as an intermediate representation for TST. With thorough experimental evaluation we show T-STAR significantly outperforms state of the art techniques by achieving on an average 15.2% higher content preservation with negligible loss (3% approx.) in style accuracy. Through detailed human evaluation with 90,000 ratings, we also show that T-STAR has up to 50% lesser hallucinations compared to state of the art TST models.","No"

"Language Models as Agent Models","Jacob Andreas",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01681","Language models (LMs) are trained on collections of documents, written by individual human agents to achieve specific goals in an outside world. During training, LMs have access only to text of these documents, with no direct evidence of the internal states of the agents that produced them -- a fact often used to argue that LMs are incapable of modeling goal-directed aspects of human language production and comprehension. Can LMs trained on text learn anything at all about the relationship between language and use? I argue that LMs are models of intentional communication in a specific, narrow sense. When performing next word prediction given a textual context, an LM can infer and represent properties of an agent likely to have produced that context. These representations can in turn influence subsequent LM generation in the same way that agents' communicative intentions influence their language. I survey findings from the recent literature showing that -- even in today's non-robust and error-prone models -- LMs infer and use representations of fine-grained communicative intentions and more abstract beliefs and goals. Despite the limited nature of their training data, they can thus serve as building blocks for systems that communicate and act intentionally.","No"
"What is Not in the Context? Evaluation of Few-shot Learners with Informative Demonstrations","Michal \v{S}tef\'anik and Marek Kadl\v{c}\'ik",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01692","Large language models demonstrate an emergent ability to learn a new task from a small number of input-output demonstrations, referred to as in-context few-shot learning. However, recent work shows that in such settings, models mainly learn to mimic the new task distribution, instead of the mechanics of the new task. We argue that the commonly-used evaluation settings of few-shot models utilizing a random selection of in-context demonstrations is not able to disentangle models' ability to learn new skills from demonstrations, as most of the such-selected demonstrations are not informative for prediction beyond exposing the new task's input and output distribution. Therefore, we introduce an evaluation technique that disentangles few-shot learners' gain from in-context learning by picking the demonstrations sharing a specific, informative concept with the predicted sample, in addition to the performance reached by mainly non-informative samples. We find that regardless of the model size, existing few-shot learners are not able to benefit from observing such informative concepts in demonstrations. We also find that such ability may not be obtained trivially by exposing the informative demonstrations in the training process, leaving the challenge of training true in-context learners open.","No"
"Towards Robust NLG Bias Evaluation with Syntactically-diverse Prompts","Arshiya Aggarwal, Jiao Sun, Nanyun Peng",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01700","We present a robust methodology for evaluating biases in natural language generation(NLG) systems. Previous works use fixed hand-crafted prefix templates with mentions of various demographic groups to prompt models to generate continuations for bias analysis. These fixed prefix templates could themselves be specific in terms of styles or linguistic structures, which may lead to unreliable fairness conclusions that are not representative of the general trends from tone varying prompts. To study this problem, we paraphrase the prompts with different syntactic structures and use these to evaluate demographic bias in NLG systems. Our results suggest similar overall bias trends but some syntactic structures lead to contradictory conclusions compared to past works. We show that our methodology is more robust and that some syntactic structures prompt more toxic content while others could prompt less biased generation. This suggests the importance of not relying on a fixed syntactic structure and using tone-invariant prompts. Introducing syntactically-diverse prompts can achieve more robust NLG (bias) evaluation.","No"

"KPT: Keyword-guided Pre-training for Grounded Dialog Generation","Qi Zhu, Fei Mi, Zheng Zhang, Yasheng Wang, Yitong Li, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Xiaoyan Zhu, Minlie Huang",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01739","Incorporating external knowledge into the response generation process is essential to building more helpful and reliable dialog agents. However, collecting knowledge-grounded conversations is often costly, calling for a better pre-trained model for grounded dialog generation that generalizes well w.r.t. different types of knowledge. In this work, we propose KPT (Keyword-guided Pre-Training), a novel self-supervised pre-training method for grounded dialog generation without relying on extra knowledge annotation. Specifically, we use a pre-trained language model to extract the most uncertain tokens in the dialog as keywords. With these keywords, we construct two kinds of knowledge and pre-train a knowledge-grounded response generation model, aiming at handling two different scenarios: (1) the knowledge should be faithfully grounded; (2) it can be selectively used. For the former, the grounding knowledge consists of keywords extracted from the response. For the latter, the grounding knowledge is additionally augmented with keywords extracted from other utterances in the same dialog. Since the knowledge is extracted from the dialog itself, KPT can be easily performed on a large volume and variety of dialogue data. We considered three data sources (open-domain, task-oriented, conversational QA) with a total of 2.5M dialogues. We conduct extensive experiments on various few-shot knowledge-grounded generation tasks, including grounding on dialog acts, knowledge graphs, persona descriptions, and Wikipedia passages. Our comprehensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that KPT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on these tasks with diverse grounding knowledge.","No"
"Languages You Know Influence Those You Learn: Impact of Language Characteristics on Multi-Lingual Text-to-Text Transfer","Benjamin Muller, Deepanshu Gupta, Siddharth Patwardhan, Jean-Philippe Fauconnier, David Vandyke, Sachin Agarwal",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01757","Multi-lingual language models (LM), such as mBERT, XLM-R, mT5, mBART, have been remarkably successful in enabling natural language tasks in low-resource languages through cross-lingual transfer from high-resource ones. In this work, we try to better understand how such models, specifically mT5, transfer *any* linguistic and semantic knowledge across languages, even though no explicit cross-lingual signals are provided during pre-training. Rather, only unannotated texts from each language are presented to the model separately and independently of one another, and the model appears to implicitly learn cross-lingual connections. This raises several questions that motivate our study, such as: Are the cross-lingual connections between every language pair equally strong? What properties of source and target language impact the strength of cross-lingual transfer? Can we quantify the impact of those properties on the cross-lingual transfer? In our investigation, we analyze a pre-trained mT5 to discover the attributes of cross-lingual connections learned by the model. Through a statistical interpretation framework over 90 language pairs across three tasks, we show that transfer performance can be modeled by a few linguistic and data-derived features. These observations enable us to interpret cross-lingual understanding of the mT5 model. Through these observations, one can favorably choose the best source language for a task, and can anticipate its training data demands. A key finding of this work is that similarity of syntax, morphology and phonology are good predictors of cross-lingual transfer, significantly more than just the lexical similarity of languages. For a given language, we are able to predict zero-shot performance, that increases on a logarithmic scale with the number of few-shot target language data points.","No"

Multilingual pre-trained language models can be trained on multiple languages and understand multiple languages at the same time. At present, the research on pre-trained models mainly focuses on rich-resource language, while there is relatively little research on low-resource languages such as minority languages, and the public multilingual pre-trained language model can not work well for minority languages. Therefore, this paper constructs a multilingual pre-trained language model named MiLMo that performs better on minority language tasks, including Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh and Korean. To solve the problem of scarcity of datasets on minority languages and verify the effectiveness of the MiLMo model, this paper constructs a minority multilingual text classification dataset named MiTC, and trains a word2vec model for each language. By comparing the word2vec model and the pre-trained model in the text classification task, this paper provides an optimal scheme for the downstream task research of minority languages. The final experimental results show that the performance of the pre-trained model is better than that of the word2vec model, and it has achieved the best results in minority multilingual text classification.

In order to detect such toxic generations, existing methods rely on templates, real-world data extraction, crowdsourcing workers, or automatic generation to construct adversarial contexts that are likely to induce toxic generations. However, what type of context is more likely to induce unsafe responses is still under-explored. In this paper, we identify that context toxicity and context category (e.g., \textit{profanity}, \textit{insult}, \textit{drugs}, etc.) are two important factors to cause safety issues in response generation. Hence, we propose a method called \emph{reverse generation} to construct adversarial contexts conditioned on a given response, with the flexibility to control category, toxicity level, and inductivity of the generated contexts. Via reverse generation, we augment the existing BAD dataset and construct a new dataset BAD+ which contains more than 120K diverse and highly inductive contexts in 12 categories. We test three popular pretrained dialogue models (Blender, DialoGPT, and Plato2) and find that BAD+ can largely expose their safety problems. Furthermore, we show that BAD+ can greatly enhance the safety of generation and reveal the key factors of safety improvement.

"Pair-Based Joint Encoding with Relational Graph Convolutional Networks for Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction","Junlong Liu, Xichen Shang, Qianli Ma",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01844","Emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE) aims to extract emotion clauses and corresponding cause clauses, which have recently received growing attention. Previous methods sequentially encode features with a specified order. They first encode the emotion and cause features for clause extraction and then combine them for pair extraction. This lead to an imbalance in inter-task feature interaction where features extracted later have no direct contact with the former. To address this issue, we propose a novel Pair-Based Joint Encoding (PBJE) network, which generates pairs and clauses features simultaneously in a joint feature encoding manner to model the causal relationship in clauses. PBJE can balance the information flow among emotion clauses, cause clauses and pairs. From a multi-relational perspective, we construct a heterogeneous undirected graph and apply the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) to capture the various relationship between clauses and the relationship between pairs and clauses. Experimental results show that PBJE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Chinese benchmark corpus.","No"

[Method] Instead of arbitrarily increasing the size of a pretrained language model (PLM), our aim is to 1) fully extract knowledge from the input pretraining data given a certain parameter budget, e.g., 6B, and 2) effectively transfer this knowledge to downstream tasks. To achieve goal 1), we propose self-evolution learning for PLMs to wisely predict the informative tokens that should be masked, and supervise the masked language modeling (MLM) process with rectified smooth labels. For goal 2), we leverage the prompt transfer technique to improve the low-resource tasks by transferring the knowledge from the foundation model and related downstream tasks to the target task.

We introduce a dataset called DeltaWords, which evaluates a model's ability to follow instructions to select a sentence which replaces the target word with its antonym. We show a weak inverse scaling trend, where task accuracy degrades as model size increase, under extremely few-shot prompting regimes.

We highlight what valuable aspects of cross-lingual similarity these indexes fail to capture and provide a motivating case study \textit{demonstrating the problem empirically}. Then, we introduce \textit{Average Neuron-Wise Correlation (ANC)} as a straightforward alternative that is exempt from the difficulties of CKA/CCA and is good specifically in a cross-lingual context.

The vocabulary used to describe building metadata appears small compared to general natural languages, but each term has multiple commonly used abbreviations. Conventional machine learning techniques are inefficient since they need to learn many different forms for the same word, and large amounts of data must be used to train these models. It is also difficult to apply standard techniques such as tokenisation since this commonly results in multiple output tags being associated with a single input token, something traditional sequence labelling models do not allow. Finite State Transducers can model sequence-to-sequence tasks where the input and output sequences are different lengths, and they can be combined with language models to ensure a valid output sequence is generated.

The model is then fine-tuned for the headline generation task using a massive news corpus. The system is evaluated by 3 expert journalists working in a Finnish media house. The results showcase the usability of the presented approach as a headline suggestion tool to facilitate the news production process.","No"
"Momentum Decoding: Open-ended Text Generation As Graph Exploration","Tian Lan and Yixuan Su and Shuhang Liu and Heyan Huang and Xian-Ling Mao",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02175","Open-ended text generation with autoregressive language models (LMs) is one of the core tasks in natural language processing. However, maximization-based decoding methods (e.g., greedy/beam search) often lead to the degeneration problem, i.e., the generated text is unnatural and contains undesirable repetitions. Existing solutions to this problem either introduce randomness prone to incoherence or require a look-ahead mechanism that demands extra computational overhead. In this study, we formulate open-ended text generation from a new perspective, i.e., we view it as an exploration process within a directed graph. Thereby, we understand the phenomenon of degeneration as circular loops within the directed graph. Based on our formulation, we propose a novel decoding method -- \textit{momentum decoding} -- which encourages the LM to \textit{greedily} explore new nodes outside the current graph. Meanwhile, it also allows the LM to return to the existing nodes with a momentum downgraded by a pre-defined resistance function. We extensively test our approach on three benchmarks from different domains through automatic and human evaluations. The results show that momentum decoding performs comparably with the current state of the art while enjoying notably improved inference speed and computation FLOPs. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis to reveal the merits and inner workings of our approach.

Our goal is to use LPE with LLMs over long legal documents for the Legal Judgement Prediction (LJP) task. We investigate the performance of zero-shot LPE for given facts in case-texts from the European Court of Human Rights (in English) and the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland (in German, French and Italian). Our results show that zero-shot LPE is better compared to the baselines, but it still falls short compared to current state of the art supervised approaches. Nevertheless, the results are important, since there was 1) no explicit domain-specific data used - so we show that the transfer to the legal domain is possible for general-purpose LLMs, and 2) the LLMs where directly applied without any further training or fine-tuning - which in turn saves immensely in terms of additional computational costs.","No"
"Improving Few-Shot Performance of Language Models via Nearest Neighbor Calibration","Feng Nie, Meixi Chen, Zhirui Zhang, Xu Cheng",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02216","Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have exhibited remarkable few-shot learning capabilities when provided a few examples in a natural language prompt as demonstrations of test instances, i.e., in-context learning. However, the performance of in-context learning is susceptible to the choice of prompt format, training examples and the ordering of the training examples. In this paper, we propose a novel nearest-neighbor calibration framework for in-context learning to ease this issue. It is inspired by a phenomenon that the in-context learning paradigm produces incorrect labels when inferring training instances, which provides a useful supervised signal to calibrate predictions. Thus, our method directly augments the predictions with a $k$-nearest-neighbor ($k$NN) classifier over a datastore of cached few-shot instance representations obtained by PLMs and their corresponding labels. Then adaptive neighbor selection and feature regularization modules are introduced to make full use of a few support instances to reduce the $k$NN retrieval noise. Experiments on various few-shot text classification tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves in-context learning, while even achieving comparable performance with state-of-the-art tuning-based approaches in some sentiment analysis tasks.","No"

"Addressing Distribution Shift at Test Time in Pre-trained Language Models","Ayush Singh, John E. Ortega",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02384","State-of-the-art pre-trained language models (PLMs) outperform other models when applied to the majority of language processing tasks. However, PLMs have been found to degrade in performance under distribution shift, a phenomenon that occurs when data at test-time does not come from the same distribution as the source training set. Equally as challenging is the task of obtaining labels in real-time due to issues like long-labeling feedback loops. The lack of adequate methods that address the aforementioned challenges constitutes the need for approaches that continuously adapt the PLM to a distinct distribution. Unsupervised domain adaptation adapts a source model to an unseen as well as unlabeled target domain. While some techniques such as data augmentation can adapt models in several scenarios, they have only been sparsely studied for addressing the distribution shift problem. In this work, we present an approach (MEMO-CL) that improves the performance of PLMs at test-time under distribution shift. Our approach takes advantage of the latest unsupervised techniques in data augmentation and adaptation to minimize the entropy of the PLM's output distribution. MEMO-CL operates on a batch of augmented samples from a single observation in the test set. The technique introduced is unsupervised, domain-agnostic, easy to implement, and requires no additional data. Our experiments result in a 3% improvement over current test-time adaptation baselines.","No"

For Machine Translation (MT), these examples are typically randomly sampled from the development dataset with a similar distribution as the evaluation set. However, it is unclear how the choice of these in-context examples and their ordering impacts the output translation quality. In this work, we aim to understand the properties of good in-context examples for MT in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. We show that the translation quality and the domain of the in-context examples matter and that 1-shot noisy unrelated example can have a catastrophic impact on output quality. While concatenating multiple random examples reduces the effect of noise, a single good prompt optimized to maximize translation quality on the development dataset can elicit learned information from the pre-trained language model. Adding similar examples based on an n-gram overlap with the test source significantly and consistently improves the translation quality of the outputs, outperforming a strong kNN-MT baseline in 2 out of 4 out-of-domain datasets.","No"

However, linear programming algorithms and approximate OT solvers via Sinkhorn for computing the permutation matrix come with a significant computational burden since they scale cubically and quadratically, respectively, in the input size. This makes it slow and infeasible to compute OT distances exactly for a larger input size, resulting in a poor approximation quality of the permutation matrix and subsequently a less robust learned transfer function or mapper. This paper proposes an unsupervised projection-based CLWE model called quantized Wasserstein Procrustes (qWP). qWP relies on a quantization step of both the source and target monolingual embedding space to estimate the permutation matrix given a cheap sampling procedure. This approach substantially improves the approximation quality of empirical OT solvers given fixed computational cost. We demonstrate that qWP achieves state-of-the-art results on the Bilingual lexicon Induction (BLI) task.","No"

Additionally, current speech recognition models and continual learning algorithms are not optimized to be compute-efficient. We adapt a general-purpose training algorithm NetAug for ASR and create a novel Conformer variant called the DisConformer (Disentangled Conformer).

Traditionally, platforms have relied on moderators to -- with or without algorithmic assistance -- take corrective actions such as removing comments or banning users. In this work we propose a complementary paradigm that directly empowers users by proactively enhancing their awareness about existing tension in the conversation they are engaging in and actively guides them as they are drafting their replies to avoid further escalation. As a proof of concept for this paradigm, we design an algorithmic tool that provides such proactive information directly to users, and conduct a user study in a popular discussion platform. Through a mixed methods approach combining surveys with a randomized controlled experiment, we uncover qualitative and quantitative insights regarding how the participants utilize and react to this information. Most participants report finding this proactive paradigm valuable, noting that it helps them to identify tension that they may have otherwise missed and prompts them to further reflect on their own replies and to revise them. These effects are corroborated by a comparison of how the participants draft their reply when our tool warns them that their conversation is at risk of derailing into uncivil behavior versus in a control condition where the tool is disabled. These preliminary findings highlight the potential of this user-centered paradigm and point to concrete directions for future implementations.","No"

Such models typically lead to poor performance during inference for data lacking such correlations. In this work, we explicitly consider a situation where potential spurious correlations are present in the majority of training data. In contrast with existing approaches, which use the ERM model outputs to detect the samples without spurious correlations, and either heuristically upweighting or upsampling those samples; we propose the logit correction (LC) loss, a simple yet effective improvement on the softmax cross-entropy loss, to correct the sample logit. We demonstrate that minimizing the LC loss is equivalent to maximizing the group-balanced accuracy, so the proposed LC could mitigate the negative impacts of spurious correlations. Our extensive experimental results further reveal that the proposed LC loss outperforms the SoTA solutions on multiple popular benchmarks by a large margin, an average 5.5% absolute improvement, without access to spurious attribute labels. LC is also competitive with oracle methods that make use of the attribute labels. Code is available at https://github.com/shengliu66/LC.","No"

We resolve this problem by proposing a novel algorithm named GLM2FSA, which obtains high-level task knowledge, represented in a finite state automaton (FSA), from a given brief description of the task goal. GLM2FSA sends queries to a GLM for task knowledge in textual form and then builds a FSA to represent the textual knowledge.

"DeepE: a deep neural network for knowledge graph embedding","Zhu Danhao, Shen Si, Huang Shujian, Yin Chang, Ding Ziqi",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04620","Recently, neural network based methods have shown their power in learning more expressive features on the task of knowledge graph embedding (KGE). However, the performance of deep methods often falls behind the shallow ones on simple graphs. One possible reason is that deep models are difficult to train, while shallow models might suffice for accurately representing the structure of the simple KGs. In this paper, we propose a neural network based model, named DeepE, to address the problem, which stacks multiple building blocks to predict the tail entity based on the head entity and the relation. Each building block is an addition of a linear and a non-linear function. The stacked building blocks are equivalent to a group of learning functions with different non-linear depth. Hence, DeepE allows deep functions to learn deep features, and shallow functions to learn shallow features.

The proposed method contains two key modules: the adaptive shared (AS) part and the attentive conditional random field (ACRF) module. The former part automatically assigns adaptive weights across each task to achieve optimal recognition accuracy in the multi-layer network. The latter module employs the attention operation to model the dependency between different entities. In this way, our model could learn better entity representations by capturing the implicit distinctions and relationships between different categories of entities. Extensive experiments on public datasets verify the effectiveness of our method. Besides, we also perform ablation analyses to deeply understand our methods.","No"
"Distribution-based Emotion Recognition in Conversation","Wen Wu, Chao Zhang, Philip C. Woodland",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04834","Automatic emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) is crucial for emotion-aware conversational artificial intelligence. This paper proposes a distribution-based framework that formulates ERC as a sequence-to-sequence problem for emotion distribution estimation. The inherent ambiguity of emotions and the subjectivity of human perception lead to disagreements in emotion labels, which is handled naturally in our framework from the perspective of uncertainty estimation in emotion distributions. A Bayesian training loss is introduced to improve the uncertainty estimation by conditioning each emotional state on an utterance-specific Dirichlet prior distribution. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that ERC outperformed the single-utterance-based system, and the proposed distribution-based ERC methods have not only better classification accuracy, but also show improved uncertainty estimation.","No"
"Mask More and Mask Later: Efficient Pre-training of Masked Language Models by Disentangling the [MASK] Token","Baohao Liao, David Thulke, Sanjika Hewavitharana, Hermann Ney, Christof Monz",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04898","The pre-training of masked language models (MLMs) consumes massive computation to achieve good results on downstream NLP tasks, resulting in a large carbon footprint. In the vanilla MLM, the virtual tokens, [MASK]s, act as placeholders and gather the contextualized information from unmasked tokens to restore the corrupted information. It raises the question of whether we can append [MASK]s at a later layer, to reduce the sequence length for earlier layers and make the pre-training more efficient. We show: (1) [MASK]s can indeed be appended at a later layer, being disentangled from the word embedding; (2) The gathering of contextualized information from unmasked tokens can be conducted with a few layers. By further increasing the masking rate from 15% to 50%, we can pre-train RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large from scratch with only 78% and 68% of the original computational budget without any degradation on the GLUE benchmark. When pre-training with the original budget, our method outperforms RoBERTa for 6 out of 8 GLUE tasks, on average by 0.4%.","No"
"Novel Chapter Abstractive Summarization using Spinal Tree Aware Sub-Sentential Content Selection","Hardy Hardy, Miguel Ballesteros, Faisal Ladhak, Muhammad Khalifa, Vittorio Castelli, Kathleen McKeown",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04903","Summarizing novel chapters is a difficult task due to the input length and the fact that sentences that appear in the desired summaries draw content from multiple places throughout the chapter. We present a pipelined extractive-abstractive approach where the extractive step filters the content that is passed to the abstractive component. Extremely lengthy input also results in a highly skewed dataset towards negative instances for extractive summarization; we thus adopt a margin ranking loss for extraction to encourage separation between positive and negative examples. Our extraction component operates at the constituent level; our approach to this problem enriches the text with spinal tree information which provides syntactic context (in the form of constituents) to the extraction model. We show an improvement of 3.71 Rouge-1 points over best results reported in prior work on an existing novel chapter dataset.","No"
"miCSE: Mutual Information Contrastive Learning for Low-shot Sentence Embeddings","Tassilo Klein and Moin Nabi",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04928","This paper presents miCSE, a mutual information-based Contrastive learning framework that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in few-shot sentence embedding. The proposed approach imposes alignment between the attention pattern of different views during contrastive learning. Learning sentence embeddings with miCSE entails enforcing the syntactic consistency across augmented views for every single sentence, making contrastive self-supervised learning more sample efficient. As a result, the proposed approach shows strong performance in the few-shot learning domain. While it achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks in few-shot learning, it is comparable in the full-shot scenario. The proposed approach is conceptually simple, easy to implement and optimize, yet empirically powerful. This study opens up avenues for efficient self-supervised learning methods that are more robust than current contrastive methods for sentence embedding.","No"
"DoSA : A System to Accelerate Annotations on Business Documents with Human-in-the-Loop","Neelesh K Shukla, Msp Raja, Raghu Katikeri, Amit Vaid",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04934","Business documents come in a variety of structures, formats and information needs which makes information extraction a challenging task. Due to these variations, having a document generic model which can work well across all types of documents and for all the use cases seems far-fetched. For document-specific models, we would need customized document-specific labels. We introduce DoSA (Document Specific Automated Annotations), which helps annotators in generating initial annotations automatically using our novel bootstrap approach by leveraging document generic datasets and models. These initial annotations can further be reviewed by a human for correctness. An initial document-specific model can be trained and its inference can be used as feedback for generating more automated annotations. These automated annotations can be reviewed by human-in-the-loop for the correctness and a new improved model can be trained using the current model as pre-trained model before going for the next iteration. In this paper, our scope is limited to Form like documents due to limited availability of generic annotated datasets, but this idea can be extended to a variety of other documents as more datasets are built. An open-source ready-to-use implementation is made available on GitHub https://github.com/neeleshkshukla/DoSA.","No"
"Efficient Speech Translation with Pre-trained Models","Zhaolin Li, Jan Niehues",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04939","When building state-of-the-art speech translation models, the need for large computational resources is a significant obstacle due to the large training data size and complex models. The availability of pre-trained models is a promising opportunity to build strong speech translation systems efficiently. In a first step, we investigate efficient strategies to build cascaded and end-to-end speech translation systems based on pre-trained models. Using this strategy, we can train and apply the models on a single GPU. While the end-to-end models show superior translation performance to cascaded ones, the application of this technology has a limitation on the need for additional end-to-end training data. In a second step, we proposed an additional similarity loss to encourage the model to generate similar hidden representations for speech and transcript. Using this technique, we can increase the data efficiency and improve the translation quality by 6 BLEU points in scenarios with limited end-to-end training data.","No"
"Evaluating and Improving Context Attention Distribution on Multi-Turn Response Generation using Self-Contained Distractions","Yujie Xing and Jon Atle Gulla",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04943","Despite the rapid progress of open-domain generation-based conversational agents, most deployed systems treat dialogue contexts as single-turns, while systems dealing with multi-turn contexts are less studied. There is a lack of a reliable metric for evaluating multi-turn modelling, as well as an effective solution for improving it. In this paper, we focus on an essential component of multi-turn generation-based conversational agents: context attention distribution, i.e. how systems distribute their attention on dialogue's context. For evaluation of this component, We introduce a novel attention-mechanism-based metric: DAS ratio. To improve performance on this component, we propose an optimization strategy that employs self-contained distractions. Our experiments on the Ubuntu chatlogs dataset show that models with comparable perplexity can be distinguished by their ability on context attention distribution. Our proposed optimization strategy improves both non-hierarchical and hierarchical models on the proposed metric by about 10% from baselines.","No"

Through (2) an in-depth analysis of the effect of the fine-tuning, we show (3) that a small amount of curated data suffices to generate scene descriptions without losing the capability to identify object-level concepts in the scene; the model acquires a more holistic view of the image compared to when object-centric descriptions are generated. We discuss the parallels between these results and insights from computational and cognitive science research on scene perception.","No"
"Discord Questions: A Computational Approach To Diversity Analysis in News Coverage","Philippe Laban, Chien-Sheng Wu, Lidiya Murakhovs'ka, Xiang 'Anthony' Chen, Caiming Xiong",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05007","There are many potential benefits to news readers accessing diverse sources. Modern news aggregators do the hard work of organizing the news, offering readers a plethora of source options, but choosing which source to read remains challenging. We propose a new framework to assist readers in identifying source differences and gaining an understanding of news coverage diversity. The framework is based on the generation of Discord Questions: questions with a diverse answer pool, explicitly illustrating source differences. To assemble a prototype of the framework, we focus on two components: (1) discord question generation, the task of generating questions answered differently by sources, for which we propose an automatic scoring method, and create a model that improves performance from current question generation (QG) methods by 5%, (2) answer consolidation, the task of grouping answers to a question that are semantically similar, for which we collect data and repurpose a method that achieves 81% balanced accuracy on our realistic test set. We illustrate the framework's feasibility through a prototype interface. Even though model performance at discord QG still lags human performance by more than 15%, generated questions are judged to be more interesting than factoid questions and can reveal differences in the level of detail, sentiment, and reasoning of sources in news coverage.","No"
"Detecting Languages Unintelligible to Multilingual Models through Local Structure Probes","Louis Clou\^atre and Prasanna Parthasarathi and Amal Zouaq and Sarath Chandar",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05015","Providing better language tools for low-resource and endangered languages is imperative for equitable growth. Recent progress with massively multilingual pretrained models has proven surprisingly effective at performing zero-shot transfer to a wide variety of languages. However, this transfer is not universal, with many languages not currently understood by multilingual approaches. It is estimated that only 72 languages possess a 'small set of labeled datasets' on which we could test a model's performance, the vast majority of languages not having the resources available to simply evaluate performances on. In this work, we attempt to clarify which languages do and do not currently benefit from such transfer. To that end, we develop a general approach that requires only unlabelled text to detect which languages are not well understood by a cross-lingual model. Our approach is derived from the hypothesis that if a model's understanding is insensitive to perturbations to text in a language, it is likely to have a limited understanding of that language. We construct a cross-lingual sentence similarity task to evaluate our approach empirically on 350, primarily low-resource, languages.","No"

Such insight may be used to direct future research into English NLP models. As many improvements in multilingual settings consist of wholesale adaptation of English approaches, it is important to verify whether those studies replicate or not in multilingual settings. In this work, we replicate a study on the importance of local structure, and the relative unimportance of global structure, in a multilingual setting. We find that the phenomenon observed on the English language broadly translates to over 120 languages, with a few caveats.","No"
"Improving Performance of Automatic Keyword Extraction (AKE) Methods Using PoS-Tagging and Enhanced Semantic-Awareness","Enes Altuncu, Jason R.C. Nurse, Yang Xu, Jie Guo, Shujun Li",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05031","Automatic keyword extraction (AKE) has gained more importance with the increasing amount of digital textual data that modern computing systems process. It has various applications in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP), including text summarisation, topic analysis and document indexing. This paper proposes a simple but effective post-processing-based universal approach to improve the performance of any AKE methods, via an enhanced level of semantic-awareness supported by PoS-tagging. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, we considered word types retrieved from a PoS-tagging step and two representative sources of semantic information -- specialised terms defined in one or more context-dependent thesauri, and named entities in Wikipedia. The above three steps can be simply added to the end of any AKE methods as part of a post-processor, which simply re-evaluate all candidate keywords following some context-specific and semantic-aware criteria. For five state-of-the-art (SOTA) AKE methods, our experimental results with 17 selected datasets showed that the proposed approach improved their performances both consistently (up to 100\% in terms of improved cases) and significantly (between 10.2\% and 53.8\%, with an average of 25.8\%, in terms of F1-score and across all five methods), especially when all the three enhancement steps are used. Our results have profound implications considering the ease to apply our proposed approach to any AKE methods and to further extend it.","No"
"Combining Contrastive Learning and Knowledge Graph Embeddings to develop medical word embeddings for the Italian language","Denys Amore Bondarenko, Roger Ferrod, Luigi Di Caro",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05035","Word embeddings play a significant role in today's Natural Language Processing tasks and applications. While pre-trained models may be directly employed and integrated into existing pipelines, they are often fine-tuned to better fit with specific languages or domains. In this paper, we attempt to improve available embeddings in the uncovered niche of the Italian medical domain through the combination of Contrastive Learning (CL) and Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE). The main objective is to improve the accuracy of semantic similarity between medical terms, which is also used as an evaluation task. Since the Italian language lacks medical texts and controlled vocabularies, we have developed a specific solution by combining preexisting CL methods (multi-similarity loss, contextualization, dynamic sampling) and the integration of KGEs, creating a new variant of the loss. Although without having outperformed the state-of-the-art, represented by multilingual models, the obtained results are encouraging, providing a significant leap in performance compared to the starting model, while using a significantly lower amount of data.","No"

However, due to the lack of designated annotations of controlled summaries, existing works have to craft pseudo datasets by adapting generic summarization benchmarks. Furthermore, most research focuses on controlling single attributes individually (e.g., a short summary or a highly abstractive summary) rather than controlling a mix of attributes together (e.g., a short and highly abstractive summary). In this paper, we propose MACSum, the first human-annotated summarization dataset for controlling mixed attributes. It contains source texts from two domains, news articles and dialogues, with human-annotated summaries controlled by five designed attributes (Length, Extractiveness, Specificity, Topic, and Speaker). We propose two simple and effective parameter-efficient approaches for the new task of mixed controllable summarization based on hard prompt tuning and soft prefix tuning. Results and analysis demonstrate that hard prompt models yield the best performance on all metrics and human evaluations. However, mixed-attribute control is still challenging for summarization tasks. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/MACSum.","No"

However, not all spreading claims are made equal. If propagated, some claims can be destructive, not only on the individual level, but to organizations and even countries. Detecting claims that should be prioritized for fact-checking is considered the first step to fight against spread of fake news. With training data limited to a handful of languages, developing supervised models to tackle the problem over lower-resource languages is currently infeasible. Therefore, our work aims to investigate whether we can use existing datasets to train models for predicting worthiness of verification of claims in tweets in other languages. We present a systematic comparative study of six approaches for cross-lingual check-worthiness estimation across pairs of five diverse languages with the help of Multilingual BERT (mBERT) model. We run our experiments using a state-of-the-art multilingual Twitter dataset. Our results show that for some language pairs, zero-shot cross-lingual transfer is possible and can perform as good as monolingual models that are trained on the target language. We also show that in some languages, this approach outperforms (or at least is comparable to) state-of-the-art models.","No"

Remarkably, what further sets these models apart is the massive amounts of world knowledge they internalize during pretraining. While many downstream applications provide the model with an informational context to aid its performance on the underlying task, how the model's world knowledge interacts with the factual information presented in the context remains under explored. As a desirable behavior, an LLM should give precedence to the context whenever it contains task-relevant information that conflicts with the model's memorized knowledge. This enables model predictions to be grounded in the context, which can then be used to update or correct specific model predictions without frequent retraining. By contrast, when the context is irrelevant to the task, the model should ignore it and fall back on its internal knowledge. In this paper, we undertake a first joint study of the aforementioned two properties, namely controllability and robustness, in the context of LLMs. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art T5 and PaLM (both pretrained and finetuned) could exhibit poor controllability and robustness, which do not scale with increasing model size. As a solution, we propose a novel method - Knowledge Aware FineTuning (KAFT) - to strengthen both controllability and robustness by incorporating counterfactual and irrelevant contexts to standard supervised datasets.

"Accountable and Explainable Methods for Complex Reasoning over Text","Pepa Atanasova",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04946","A major concern of Machine Learning (ML) models is their opacity. They are deployed in an increasing number of applications where they often operate as black boxes that do not provide explanations for their predictions. Among others, the potential harms associated with the lack of understanding of the models' rationales include privacy violations, adversarial manipulations, and unfair discrimination. As a result, the accountability and transparency of ML models have been posed as critical desiderata by works in policy and law, philosophy, and computer science. In computer science, the decision-making process of ML models has been studied by developing accountability and transparency methods. Accountability methods, such as adversarial attacks and diagnostic datasets, expose vulnerabilities of ML models that could lead to malicious manipulations or systematic faults in their predictions. Transparency methods explain the rationales behind models' predictions gaining the trust of relevant stakeholders and potentially uncovering mistakes and unfairness in models' decisions. To this end, transparency methods have to meet accountability requirements as well, e.g., being robust and faithful to the underlying rationales of a model.

In this work, we commissioned 13 professional, published writers from a diverse set of creative writing backgrounds to craft stories using Wordcraft, a text editor with built-in AI-powered writing assistance tools. Using interviews and participant journals, we discuss the potential of NLG to have significant impact in the creative writing domain--especially with respect to brainstorming, generation of story details, world-building, and research assistance. Experienced writers, more so than amateurs, typically have well-developed systems and methodologies for writing, as well as distinctive voices and target audiences. Our work highlights the challenges in building for these writers; NLG technologies struggle to preserve style and authorial voice, and they lack deep understanding of story contents.

"Identifying gender bias in blockbuster movies through the lens of machine learning","Muhammad Junaid Haris, Aanchal Upreti, Melih Kurtaran, Filip Ginter, Sebastien Lafond, Sepinoud Azimi",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12504","The problem of gender bias is highly prevalent and well known. In this paper, we have analysed the portrayal of gender roles in English movies, a medium that effectively influences society in shaping people's beliefs and opinions. First, we gathered scripts of films from different genres and derived sentiments and emotions using natural language processing techniques. Afterwards, we converted the scripts into embeddings, i.e. a way of representing text in the form of vectors. With a thorough investigation, we found specific patterns in male and female characters' personality traits in movies that align with societal stereotypes. Furthermore, we used mathematical and machine learning techniques and found some biases wherein men are shown to be more dominant and envious than women, whereas women have more joyful roles in movies. In our work, we introduce, to the best of our knowledge, a novel technique to convert dialogues into an array of emotions by combining it with Plutchik's wheel of emotions. Our study aims to encourage reflections on gender equality in the domain of film and facilitate other researchers in analysing movies automatically instead of using manual approaches.","No"
"Time-Aware Datasets are Adaptive Knowledgebases for the New Normal","Abhijit Suprem, Sanjyot Vaidya, Joao Eduardo Ferreira, Calton Pu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12508","Recent advances in text classification and knowledge capture in language models have relied on availability of large-scale text datasets. However, language models are trained on static snapshots of knowledge and are limited when that knowledge evolves. This is especially critical for misinformation detection, where new types of misinformation continuously appear, replacing old campaigns. We propose time-aware misinformation datasets to capture time-critical phenomena. In this paper, we first present evidence of evolving misinformation and show that incorporating even simple time-awareness significantly improves classifier accuracy. Second, we present COVID-TAD, a large-scale COVID-19 misinformation da-taset spanning 25 months. It is the first large-scale misinformation dataset that contains multiple snapshots of a datastream and is orders of magnitude bigger than related misinformation datasets.

"NLP meets psychotherapy: Using predicted client emotions and self-reported client emotions to measure emotional coherence","Neha Warikoo, Tobias Mayer, Dana Atzil-Slonim, Amir Eliassaf, Shira Haimovitz, Iryna Gurevych",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12512","Emotions are experienced and expressed through various response systems. Coherence between emotional experience and emotional expression is considered important to clients' well being. To date, emotional coherence (EC) has been studied at a single time point using lab-based tasks with relatively small datasets. No study has examined EC between the subjective experience of emotions and emotion expression in therapy or whether this coherence is associated with clients' well being. Natural language Processing (NLP) approaches have been applied to identify emotions from psychotherapy dialogue, which can be implemented to study emotional processes on a larger scale. However, these methods have yet to be used to study coherence between emotional experience and emotional expression over the course of therapy and whether it relates to clients' well-being. This work presents an end-to-end approach where we use emotion predictions from our transformer based emotion recognition model to study emotional coherence and its diagnostic potential in psychotherapy research. We first employ our transformer based approach on a Hebrew psychotherapy dataset to automatically label clients' emotions at utterance level in psychotherapy dialogues. We subsequently investigate the emotional coherence between clients' self-reported emotional states and our model-based emotion predictions. We also examine the association between emotional coherence and clients' well being. Our findings indicate a significant correlation between clients' self-reported emotions and positive and negative emotions expressed verbally during psychotherapy sessions. Coherence in positive emotions was also highly correlated with clients well-being. These results illustrate how NLP can be applied to identify important emotional processes in psychotherapy to improve diagnosis and treatment for clients suffering from mental-health problems.","No"

In this paper we address this gap by tackling offensive language identification in Marathi, a low-resource Indo-Aryan language spoken in India. We introduce the Marathi Offensive Language Dataset v.2.0 or MOLD 2.0 and present multiple experiments on this dataset. MOLD 2.0 is a much larger version of MOLD with expanded annotation to the levels B (type) and C (target) of the popular OLID taxonomy.

"Program of Thoughts Prompting: Disentangling Computation from Reasoning for Numerical Reasoning Tasks","Wenhu Chen, Xueguang Ma, Xinyi Wang, William W. Cohen",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12588","Recently, there has been significant progress in teaching language models to perform step-by-step reasoning to solve complex numerical reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thoughts prompting (CoT) is by far the state-of-art method for these tasks. CoT uses language models to perform both reasoning and computation in the multi-step `thought' process. To disentangle computation from reasoning, we propose `Program of Thoughts' (PoT), which uses language models (mainly Codex) to express the reasoning process as a program. The computation is relegated to an external computer, which executes the generated programs to derive the answer. We evaluate PoT on five math word problem datasets (GSM, AQuA, SVAMP, TabMWP, MultiArith) and three financial-QA datasets (FinQA, ConvFinQA, TATQA) for both few-shot and zero-shot setups. Under both few-shot and zero-shot settings, PoT can show an average performance gain over CoT by around 12\% across all the evaluated datasets. By combining PoT with self-consistency decoding, we can achieve SoTA performance on all math problem datasets and near-SoTA performance on financial datasets. All of our data and code are released in Github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/wenhuchen/Program-of-Thoughts}}.","No"

In this paper, we show that without external classifiers, dialogue models can detect errors in their own messages introspectively, by calculating the likelihood of replies that are indicative of poor messages. For example, if an agent believes its partner is likely to respond 'I don't understand' to a candidate message, that message may not make sense, so an alternative message should be chosen. We evaluate our approach on a dataset from the game Diplomacy, which contains long dialogues richly grounded in the game state, on which existing models make many errors. We first show that hand-crafted replies can be effective for the task of detecting nonsense in applications as complex as Diplomacy. We then design AutoReply, an algorithm to search for such discriminative replies automatically, given a small number of annotated dialogue examples. We find that AutoReply-generated replies outperform handcrafted replies and perform on par with carefully fine-tuned large supervised models. Results also show that one single reply without much computation overheads can also detect dialogue nonsense reasonably well.","No"

Prior work has mostly relied on two data generation strategies. The first is human annotation, which yields linguistically diverse data but is difficult to scale. The second category for creation is synthetic generation, which is scalable and cost effective but lacks inventiveness. In this research, we present a framework for semi-automatically recasting existing tabular data to make use of the benefits of both approaches. We utilize our framework to build tabular NLI instances from five datasets that were initially intended for tasks like table2text creation, tabular Q/A, and semantic parsing. We demonstrate that recasted data could be used as evaluation benchmarks as well as augmentation data to enhance performance on tabular NLI tasks. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of models trained on recasted data in the zero-shot scenario, and analyse trends in performance across different recasted datasets types.","No"

"Word-Level Representation From Bytes For Language Modeling","Chu-Tak Lee, Qipeng Guo, Xipeng Qiu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12677","Modern language models mostly take sub-words as input, a design that balances the trade-off between vocabulary size, number of parameters, and performance. However, sub-word tokenization still has disadvantages like not being robust to noise and difficult to generalize to new languages. Also, the current trend of scaling up models reveals that larger models require larger embeddings but that makes parallelization hard. Previous work on image classification proves splitting raw input into a sequence of chucks is a strong, model-agnostic inductive bias. Based on this observation, we rethink the existing character-aware method that takes character-level inputs but makes word-level sequence modeling and prediction. We overhaul this method by introducing a cross-attention network that builds word-level representation directly from bytes, and a sub-word level prediction based on word-level hidden states to avoid the time and space requirement of word-level prediction. With these two improvements combined, we have a token free model with slim input embeddings for downstream tasks. We name our method Byte2Word and perform evaluations on language modeling and text classification. Experiments show that Byte2Word is on par with the strong sub-word baseline BERT but only takes up 10\% of embedding size. We further test our method on synthetic noise and cross-lingual transfer and find it competitive to baseline methods on both settings.","No"

"Can Open-Domain QA Reader Utilize External Knowledge Efficiently like Humans?","Neeraj Varshney, Man Luo, Chitta Baral",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12707","Recent state-of-the-art open-domain QA models are typically based on a two stage retriever-reader approach in which the retriever first finds the relevant knowledge/passages and the reader then leverages that to predict the answer. Prior work has shown that the performance of the reader usually tends to improve with the increase in the number of these passages. Thus, state-of-the-art models use a large number of passages (e.g. 100) for inference. While the reader in this approach achieves high prediction performance, its inference is computationally very expensive. We humans, on the other hand, use a more efficient strategy while answering: firstly, if we can confidently answer the question using our already acquired knowledge then we do not even use the external knowledge, and in the case when we do require external knowledge, we don't read the entire knowledge at once, instead, we only read that much knowledge that is sufficient to find the answer. Motivated by this procedure, we ask a research question 'Can the open-domain QA reader utilize external knowledge efficiently like humans without sacrificing the prediction performance?' Driven by this question, we explore an approach that utilizes both 'closed-book' (leveraging knowledge already present in the model parameters) and 'open-book' inference (leveraging external knowledge). Furthermore, instead of using a large fixed number of passages for open-book inference, we dynamically read the external knowledge in multiple 'knowledge iterations'. Through comprehensive experiments on NQ and TriviaQA datasets, we demonstrate that this dynamic reading approach improves both the 'inference efficiency' and the 'prediction accuracy' of the reader. Comparing with the FiD reader, this approach matches its accuracy by utilizing just 18.32% of its reader inference cost and also outperforms it by achieving up to 55.10% accuracy on NQ Open.","No"
"Embedding Compression for Text Classification Using Dictionary Screening","Jing Zhou, Xinru Jing, Muyu Liu, Hansheng Wang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12715","In this paper, we propose a dictionary screening method for embedding compression in text classification tasks. The key purpose of this method is to evaluate the importance of each keyword in the dictionary. To this end, we first train a pre-specified recurrent neural network-based model using a full dictionary. This leads to a benchmark model, which we then use to obtain the predicted class probabilities for each sample in a dataset. Next, to evaluate the impact of each keyword in affecting the predicted class probabilities, we develop a novel method for assessing the importance of each keyword in a dictionary. Consequently, each keyword can be screened, and only the most important keywords are reserved. With these screened keywords, a new dictionary with a considerably reduced size can be constructed. Accordingly, the original text sequence can be substantially compressed. The proposed method leads to significant reductions in terms of parameters, average text sequence, and dictionary size. Meanwhile, the prediction power remains very competitive compared to the benchmark model. Extensive numerical studies are presented to demonstrate the empirical performance of the proposed method.","No"

While natural language understanding technologies can be valuable in supporting such understanding in the legal domain, the limited availability of datasets annotated for deontic modalities in the legal domain, due to the cost of hiring experts and privacy issues, is a bottleneck. To this end, we introduce, LEXDEMOD, a corpus of English contracts annotated with deontic modality expressed with respect to a contracting party or agent along with the modal triggers. We benchmark this dataset on two tasks: (i) agent-specific multi-label deontic modality classification, and (ii) agent-specific deontic modality and trigger span detection using Transformer-based (Vaswani et al., 2017) language models. Transfer learning experiments show that the linguistic diversity of modal expressions in LEXDEMOD generalizes reasonably from lease to employment and rental agreements. A small case study indicates that a model trained on LEXDEMOD can detect red flags with high recall. We believe our work offers a new research direction for deontic modality detection in the legal domain.","No"
"Breaking the Representation Bottleneck of Chinese Characters: Neural Machine Translation with Stroke Sequence Modeling","Zhijun Wang, Xuebo Liu, Min Zhang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12781","Existing research generally treats Chinese character as a minimum unit for representation. However, such Chinese character representation will suffer two bottlenecks: 1) Learning bottleneck, the learning cannot benefit from its rich internal features (e.g., radicals and strokes); and 2) Parameter bottleneck, each individual character has to be represented by a unique vector. In this paper, we introduce a novel representation method for Chinese characters to break the bottlenecks, namely StrokeNet, which represents a Chinese character by a Latinized stroke sequence (e.g., 'ao1 (concave)' to 'ajaie' and 'tu1 (convex)' to 'aeaqe'). Specifically, StrokeNet maps each stroke to a specific Latin character, thus allowing similar Chinese characters to have similar Latin representations. With the introduction of StrokeNet to neural machine translation (NMT), many powerful but not applicable techniques to non-Latin languages (e.g., shared subword vocabulary learning and ciphertext-based data augmentation) can now be perfectly implemented. Experiments on the widely-used NIST Chinese-English, WMT17 Chinese-English and IWSLT17 Japanese-English NMT tasks show that StrokeNet can provide a significant performance boost over the strong baselines with fewer model parameters, achieving 26.5 BLEU on the WMT17 Chinese-English task which is better than any previously reported results without using monolingual data.

In this work, we explore the ability of large language models (LMs) in generating sequential questions for guiding math word problem-solving. We propose various guided question generation schemes based on input conditioning and reinforcement learning. On both automatic and human quality evaluations, we find that LMs constrained with desirable question properties generate superior questions and improve the overall performance of a math word problem solver. We conduct a preliminary user study to examine the potential value of such question generation models in the education domain. Results suggest that the difficulty level of problems plays an important role in determining whether questioning improves or hinders human performance.

"GraphWOZ: Dialogue Management with Conversational Knowledge Graphs","Nicholas Thomas Walker, Stefan Ultes, Pierre Lison",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12852","We present a new approach to dialogue management using conversational knowledge graphs as core representation of the dialogue state. To this end, we introduce a new dataset, GraphWOZ, which comprises Wizard-of-Oz dialogues in which human participants interact with a robot acting as a receptionist. In contrast to most existing work on dialogue management, GraphWOZ relies on a dialogue state explicitly represented as a dynamic knowledge graph instead of a fixed set of slots. This graph is composed of a varying number of entities (such as individuals, places, events, utterances and mentions) and relations between them (such as persons being part of a group or attending an event). The graph is then regularly updated on the basis of new observations and system actions. GraphWOZ is released along with detailed manual annotations related to the user intents, system responses, and reference relations occurring in both user and system turns. Based on GraphWOZ, we present experimental results for two dialogue management tasks, namely conversational entity linking and response ranking. For conversational entity linking, we show how to connect utterance mentions to their corresponding entity in the knowledge graph with a neural model relying on a combination of both string and graph-based features. Response ranking is then performed by summarizing the relevant content of the graph into a text, which is concatenated with the dialogue history and employed as input to score possible responses to a given dialogue state.","No"
"Mitigating Data Sparsity for Short Text Topic Modeling by Topic-Semantic Contrastive Learning","Xiaobao Wu, Anh Tuan Luu, Xinshuai Dong",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12878","To overcome the data sparsity issue in short text topic modeling, existing methods commonly rely on data augmentation or the data characteristic of short texts to introduce more word co-occurrence information. However, most of them do not make full use of the augmented data or the data characteristic: they insufficiently learn the relations among samples in data, leading to dissimilar topic distributions of semantically similar text pairs. To better address data sparsity, in this paper we propose a novel short text topic modeling framework, Topic-Semantic Contrastive Topic Model (TSCTM). To sufficiently model the relations among samples, we employ a new contrastive learning method with efficient positive and negative sampling strategies based on topic semantics. This contrastive learning method refines the representations, enriches the learning signals, and thus mitigates the sparsity issue. Extensive experimental results show that our TSCTM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines regardless of the data augmentation availability, producing high-quality topics and topic distributions.","No"

"Schr\'{o}dinger's Bat: Diffusion Models Sometimes Generate Polysemous Words in Superposition","Jennifer C. White, Ryan Cotterell",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13095","Recent work has shown that despite their impressive capabilities, text-to-image diffusion models such as DALL-E 2 (Ramesh et al., 2022) can display strange behaviours when a prompt contains a word with multiple possible meanings, often generating images containing both senses of the word (Rassin et al., 2022). In this work we seek to put forward a possible explanation of this phenomenon. Using the similar Stable Diffusion model (Rombach et al., 2022), we first show that when given an input that is the sum of encodings of two distinct words, the model can produce an image containing both concepts represented in the sum. We then demonstrate that the CLIP encoder used to encode prompts (Radford et al., 2021) encodes polysemous words as a superposition of meanings, and that using linear algebraic techniques we can edit these representations to influence the senses represented in the generated images. Combining these two findings, we suggest that the homonym duplication phenomenon described by Rassin et al. (2022) is caused by diffusion models producing images representing both of the meanings that are present in superposition in the encoding of a polysemous word.","No"

In its evaluation, we have to consider the latency of the translation in addition to the quality. The latency is preferably as small as possible for users to comprehend what the speaker says with a small delay. Existing latency metrics focus on when the translation starts but do not consider adequately when the translation ends. This means such metrics do not penalize the latency caused by a long translation output, which actually delays users' comprehension. In this work, we propose a novel latency evaluation metric called Average Token Delay (ATD) that focuses on the end timings of partial translations in simultaneous translation. We discuss the advantage of ATD using simulated examples and also investigate the differences between ATD and Average Lagging with simultaneous translation experiments.","No"

However, these models store all learned knowledge (e.g., the appearance of the Eiffel Tower) in the model parameters, requiring increasingly larger models and training data to capture more knowledge. To integrate knowledge in a more scalable and modular way, we propose a retrieval-augmented multimodal model, which enables a base multimodal model (generator) to refer to relevant knowledge fetched by a retriever from external memory (e.g., multimodal documents on the web). Specifically, we implement a retriever using the pretrained CLIP model and a generator using the CM3 Transformer architecture, and train this model using the LAION dataset. Our resulting model, named Retrieval-Augmented CM3 (RA-CM3), is the first multimodal model that can retrieve and generate mixtures of text and images. We show that RA-CM3 significantly outperforms baseline multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 on both image and caption generation tasks (12 FID and 17 CIDEr improvements on MS-COCO), while requiring much less compute for training (<30% of DALL-E). Moreover, we show that RA-CM3 exhibits novel capabilities such as knowledge-intensive image generation and multimodal in-context learning.","No"

Medical imaging data is fundamentally different to natural images, and the language used to succinctly capture relevant details in medical data uses a different, narrow but semantically rich, domain-specific vocabulary. Not surprisingly, multi-modal models trained on natural image-text pairs do not tend to generalize well to the medical domain. Developing generative imaging models faithfully representing medical concepts while providing compositional diversity could mitigate the existing paucity of high-quality, annotated medical imaging datasets. In this work, we develop a strategy to overcome the large natural-medical distributional shift by adapting a pre-trained latent diffusion model on a corpus of publicly available chest x-rays (CXR) and their corresponding radiology (text) reports. We investigate the model's ability to generate high-fidelity, diverse synthetic CXR conditioned on text prompts. We assess the model outputs quantitatively using image quality metrics, and evaluate image quality and text-image alignment by human domain experts. We present evidence that the resulting model (RoentGen) is able to create visually convincing, diverse synthetic CXR images, and that the output can be controlled to a new extent by using free-form text prompts including radiology-specific language. Fine-tuning this model on a fixed training set and using it as a data augmentation method, we measure a 5% improvement of a classifier trained jointly on synthetic and real images, and a 3% improvement when trained on a larger but purely synthetic training set. Finally, we observe that this fine-tuning distills in-domain knowledge in the text-encoder and can improve its representation capabilities of certain diseases like pneumothorax by 25%.","No"

The proposed VoP is an end-to-end framework with both video & text prompts introducing, which can be regarded as a powerful baseline with only 0.1% trainable parameters. Further, based on the spatio-temporal characteristics of videos, we develop three novel video prompt mechanisms to improve the performance with different scales of trainable parameters. The basic idea of the VoP enhancement is to model the frame position, frame context, and layer function with specific trainable prompts, respectively. Extensive experiments show that compared to full fine-tuning, the enhanced VoP achieves a 1.4% average R@1 gain across five text-video retrieval benchmarks with 6x less parameter overhead.

Malayalam, the official language of the Indian state of Kerala and spoken by 35+ million people, is a low resource language in terms of available corpora for TTS systems. In this paper, we present IMaSC, a Malayalam text and speech corpora containing approximately 50 hours of recorded speech. With 8 speakers and a total of 34,473 text-audio pairs, IMaSC is larger than every other publicly available alternative. We evaluated the database by using it to train TTS models for each speaker based on a modern deep learning architecture. Via subjective evaluation, we show that our models perform significantly better in terms of naturalness compared to previous studies and publicly available models, with an average mean opinion score of 4.50, indicating that the synthesized speech is close to human quality.","No"
"Tell Me What Happened: Unifying Text-guided Video Completion via Multimodal Masked Video Generation","Tsu-Jui Fu, Licheng Yu, Ning Zhang, Cheng-Yang Fu, Jong-Chyi Su, William Yang Wang, Sean Bell",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12824","Generating a video given the first several static frames is challenging as it anticipates reasonable future frames with temporal coherence. Besides video prediction, the ability to rewind from the last frame or infilling between the head and tail is also crucial, but they have rarely been explored for video completion. Since there could be different outcomes from the hints of just a few frames, a system that can follow natural language to perform video completion may significantly improve controllability. Inspired by this, we introduce a novel task, text-guided video completion (TVC), which requests the model to generate a video from partial frames guided by an instruction. We then propose Multimodal Masked Video Generation (MMVG) to address this TVC task. During training, MMVG discretizes the video frames into visual tokens and masks most of them to perform video completion from any time point. At inference time, a single MMVG model can address all 3 cases of TVC, including video prediction, rewind, and infilling, by applying corresponding masking conditions. We evaluate MMVG in various video scenarios, including egocentric, animation, and gaming. Extensive experimental results indicate that MMVG is effective in generating high-quality visual appearances with text guidance for TVC.","No"

As the day passes, the number of COVID- 19 cases increases, and online platforms and a few news portals entertain sharing different conspiracy theories. The most popular conspiracy belief was the link between the 5G network spreading COVID-19 and the Chinese government spreading the virus as a bioweapon, which initially created racial hatred. Although some disbelief has less impact on society, others create massive destruction. For example, the 5G conspiracy led to the burn of the 5G Tower, and belief in the Chinese bioweapon story promoted an attack on the Asian-Americans. Another popular conspiracy belief was that Bill Gates spread this Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by launching a mass vaccination program to track everyone. This Conspiracy belief creates distrust issues among laypeople and creates vaccine hesitancy. This study aims to discover the conspiracy theory against the vaccine on social platforms. We performed a sentiment analysis on the 598 unique sample comments related to COVID-19 vaccines. We used two different models, BERT and Perspective API, to find out the sentiment and toxicity of the sentence toward the COVID-19 vaccine.","No"

"SeedBERT: Recovering Annotator Rating Distributions from an Aggregated Label","Aneesha Sampath, Victoria Lin, Louis-Philippe Morency",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13196","Many machine learning tasks -- particularly those in affective computing -- are inherently subjective. When asked to classify facial expressions or to rate an individual's attractiveness, humans may disagree with one another, and no single answer may be objectively correct. However, machine learning datasets commonly have just one 'ground truth' label for each sample, so models trained on these labels may not perform well on tasks that are subjective in nature. Though allowing models to learn from the individual annotators' ratings may help, most datasets do not provide annotator-specific labels for each sample. To address this issue, we propose SeedBERT, a method for recovering annotator rating distributions from a single label by inducing pre-trained models to attend to different portions of the input. Our human evaluations indicate that SeedBERT's attention mechanism is consistent with human sources of annotator disagreement. Moreover, in our empirical evaluations using large language models, SeedBERT demonstrates substantial gains in performance on downstream subjective tasks compared both to standard deep learning models and to other current models that account explicitly for annotator disagreement.","No"

While these models are trained on large internet-scale datasets, such pre-trained models are not directly introduced to any semantic localization or grounding. Most current approaches for localization or grounding rely on human-annotated localization information in the form of bounding boxes or segmentation masks. The exceptions are a few unsupervised methods that utilize architectures or loss functions geared towards localization, but they need to be trained separately. In this work, we explore how off-the-shelf diffusion models, trained with no exposure to such localization information, are capable of grounding various semantic phrases with no segmentation-specific re-training. An inference time optimization process is introduced, that is capable of generating segmentation masks conditioned on natural language. We evaluate our proposal Peekaboo for unsupervised semantic segmentation on the Pascal VOC dataset. In addition, we evaluate for referring segmentation on the RefCOCO dataset. In summary, we present a first zero-shot, open-vocabulary, unsupervised (no localization information), semantic grounding technique leveraging diffusion-based generative models with no re-training.

Recent work mainly focuses on the modalities such as image and text, for example, studies show that visual features learned from images can help visual-grounded language understanding. In this paper, we consider investigating the potential connection between offline reinforcement learning (RL) and language modeling (LM). Intuitively, RL and LM are similar in predicting the next states based on the current and previous states, which rely on both local and long-range dependency across states. To validate such an assumption, we pre-trained different offline RL tasks using Transformer and then evaluate these models on various language-related tasks. Experimental results show that our RL pre-trained models can give close performance compared with the models using the LM training objective, showing that there exist common useful features across these two modalities. To further explore the potential relationship, we investigate some factors such as Markov property and the sequential nature of RL trajectory.","No"

Our model achieved a satisfying macro-F1 score of 0.89 on the DIR test set. The model was then applied to California tweets and validated with keyword-based labels. The macro-F1 score was 0.58.

Over a wide range of tasks, we show that the lower the perplexity of the prompt is, the better the prompt is able to perform the task. As a result, we devise a method for creating prompts: (1) automatically extend a small seed set of manually written prompts by paraphrasing using GPT3 and backtranslation and (2) choose the lowest perplexity prompts to get significant gains in performance.","No"

V2C is more challenging than conventional text-to-speech tasks as it additionally requires the generated speech to exactly match the varying emotions and speaking speed presented in the video. Unlike previous works, we propose a novel movie dubbing architecture to tackle these problems via hierarchical prosody modelling, which bridges the visual information to corresponding speech prosody from three aspects: lip, face, and scene. Specifically, we align lip movement to the speech duration, and convey facial expression to speech energy and pitch via attention mechanism based on valence and arousal representations inspired by recent psychology findings. Moreover, we design an emotion booster to capture the atmosphere from global video scenes.

Recent works leverage the capabilities of large language models (LMs) to perform complex question answering in a few-shot setting by demonstrating how to output intermediate rationalizations while solving the complex question in a single pass. We introduce ``Successive Prompting'', where we iteratively break down a complex task into a simple task, solve it, and then repeat the process until we get the final solution. Successive prompting decouples the supervision for decomposing complex questions from the supervision for answering simple questions, allowing us to (1) have multiple opportunities to query in-context examples at each reasoning step (2) learn question decomposition separately from question answering, including using synthetic data, and (3) use bespoke (fine-tuned) components for reasoning steps where a large LM does not perform well. The intermediate supervision is typically manually written, which can be expensive to collect. We introduce a way to generate a synthetic dataset which can be used to bootstrap a model's ability to decompose and answer intermediate questions. Our best model (with successive prompting) achieves an improvement of ~5% absolute F1 on a few-shot version of the DROP dataset when compared with a state-of-the-art model with the same supervision.","No"

Although attempts have been made to organize and compare news items on the basis of news values, news genres receive little attention, especially the genres in a news consumer's perception. Yet, perceived news genres serve as an essential component in exploring how news has developed, as well as a precondition for understanding media effects. We approach this concept by conceptualizing and operationalizing a non-discrete framework for mapping news items in terms of genre cues. As a starting point, we propose a preliminary set of dimensions consisting of 'factuality' and 'formality'. To automatically analyze a large amount of news items, we deliver two computational models for predicting news sentences in terms of the said two dimensions. Such predictions could then be used for locating news items within our framework. This proposed approach that positions news items upon a multidimensional grid helps in deepening our insight into the evolving nature of news genres.","No"

However, MBR performs poorly with label smoothing, which is surprising as label smoothing provides decent improvement with beam search and improves generality in various tasks. In this work, we show that the issue arises from the un-consistency of label smoothing on the token-level and sequence-level distributions. We demonstrate that even though label smoothing only causes a slight change in the token-level, the sequence-level distribution is highly skewed. We coin the issue \emph{distributional over-smoothness}. To address this issue, we propose a simple and effective method, Distributional Cooling MBR (DC-MBR), which manipulates the entropy of output distributions by tuning down the Softmax temperature. We theoretically prove the equivalence between pre-tuning label smoothing factor and distributional cooling. Experiments on NMT benchmarks validate that distributional cooling improves MBR's efficiency and effectiveness in various settings.","No"

In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning method for NMT, namely ConsistTL, which can continuously transfer knowledge from the parent model during the training of the child model. Specifically, for each training instance of the child model, ConsistTL constructs the semantically-equivalent instance for the parent model and encourages prediction consistency between the parent and child for this instance, which is equivalent to the child model learning each instance under the guidance of the parent model. Experimental results on five low-resource NMT tasks demonstrate that ConsistTL results in significant improvements over strong transfer learning baselines, with a gain up to 1.7 BLEU over the existing back-translation model on the widely-used WMT17 Turkish-English benchmark.

In this work, we propose a new paradigm for steering the behavior of neural networks, centered around \textit{task vectors}. A task vector specifies a direction in the weight space of a pre-trained model, such that movement in that direction improves performance on the task. We build task vectors by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model from the weights of the same model after fine-tuning on a task. We show that these task vectors can be modified and combined together through arithmetic operations such as negation and addition, and the behavior of the resulting model is steered accordingly. Negating a task vector decreases performance on the target task, with little change in model behavior on control tasks. Moreover, adding task vectors together can improve performance on multiple tasks at once. Finally, when tasks are linked by an analogy relationship of the form ``A is to B as C is to D', combining task vectors from three of the tasks can improve performance on the fourth, even when no data from the fourth task is used for training. Overall, our experiments with several models, modalities and tasks show that task arithmetic is a simple, efficient and effective way of editing models.","No"

Our approach outperforms recent models by a large margin, with human annotators preferring the generated explanations over the ground truth in two out of three evaluated datasets. As a novel challenge in VL-NLE research, we propose the problem of multi-task VL-NLE and show that jointly training on multiple tasks can increase the explanation quality. We discuss the ethical implications of high-quality NLE generation and other issues in recent VL-NLE research.","No"
"A Modality-level Explainable Framework for Misinformation Checking in Social Networks","V\'itor Louren\c{c}o and Aline Paes",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04272","The widespread of false information is a rising concern worldwide with critical social impact, inspiring the emergence of fact-checking organizations to mitigate misinformation dissemination. However, human-driven verification leads to a time-consuming task and a bottleneck to have checked trustworthy information at the same pace they emerge. Since misinformation relates not only to the content itself but also to other social features, this paper addresses automatic misinformation checking in social networks from a multimodal perspective. Moreover, as simply naming a piece of news as incorrect may not convince the citizen and, even worse, strengthen confirmation bias, the proposal is a modality-level explainable-prone misinformation classifier framework. Our framework comprises a misinformation classifier assisted by explainable methods to generate modality-oriented explainable inferences. Preliminary findings show that the misinformation classifier does benefit from multimodal information encoding and the modality-oriented explainable mechanism increases both inferences' interpretability and completeness.","No"

Here we consider how this social balance might be disrupted by the availability of lie-detection algorithms powered by Artificial Intelligence. Will people elect to use lie detection algorithms that perform better than humans, and if so, will they show less restraint in their accusations? We built a machine learning classifier whose accuracy (67\%) was significantly better than human accuracy (50\%) in a lie-detection task and conducted an incentivized lie-detection experiment in which we measured participants' propensity to use the algorithm, as well as the impact of that use on accusation rates. We find that the few people (33\%) who elect to use the algorithm drastically increase their accusation rates (from 25\% in the baseline condition up to 86% when the algorithm flags a statement as a lie). They make more false accusations (18pp increase), but at the same time, the probability of a lie remaining undetected is much lower in this group (36pp decrease). We consider individual motivations for using lie detection algorithms and the social implications of these algorithms.","No"

Compared to criteria using N-best lists, lattice-free methods eliminate the decoding step for hypotheses generation during training, which leads to more efficient training. Experimental results show that lattice-free methods gain up to 6.5% relative improvement in word error rate compared to a sequence-level cross-entropy trained model. Compared to the N-best-list based minimum Bayes risk objectives, lattice-free methods gain 40% - 70% relative training time speedup with a small degradation in performance.","No"

However, this scheme may hamper an agent's spatial and numerical reasoning because of incomplete objects within a single view and duplicate observations across views. A potential solution is mapping discrete views into a unified birds's-eye view, which can aggregate partial and duplicate observations. Existing metric maps could achieve this goal, but they suffer from less expressive semantics (e.g. usually predefined labels) and limited map size, which weakens an agent's language grounding and long-term planning ability. Inspired by the robotics community, we introduce hybrid topo-metric maps into VLN, where a topological map is used for long-term planning and a metric map for short-term reasoning. Beyond mapping with more expressive deep features, we further design a pre-training framework via the hybrid map to learn language-informed map representations, which enhances cross-modal grounding and facilitates the final language-guided navigation goal. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the map-based route for VLN, and the proposed method sets the new state-of-the-art on three VLN benchmarks.","No"

Being, hopefully, an alternative to approaching general-purpose AI, existing generalist models are still at an early stage, where modality and task coverage is limited. To empower multi-modal task-scaling and speed up this line of research, we release a generalist model learning system, OFASys, built on top of a declarative task interface named multi-modal instruction. At the core of OFASys is the idea of decoupling multi-modal task representations from the underlying model implementations. In OFASys, a task involving multiple modalities can be defined declaratively even with just a single line of code. The system automatically generates task plans from such instructions for training and inference. It also facilitates multi-task training for diverse multi-modal workloads. As a starting point, we provide presets of 7 different modalities and 23 highly-diverse example tasks in OFASys, with which we also develop a first-in-kind, single model, OFA+, that can handle text, image, speech, video, and motion data. The single OFA+ model achieves 95% performance in average with only 16% parameters of 15 task-finetuned models, showcasing the performance reliability of multi-modal task-scaling provided by OFASys.

Specifically, we instantiate our framework using five different language models, entity embeddings obtained from six different KG embedding models, as well as two combination methods leading to several Entity-Assisted neural language models. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our framework using two publicly available datasets from the CLEF' 2019 & 2020 CheckThat! Labs.

"Pairwise Instance Relation Augmentation for Long-tailed Multi-label Text Classification","Lin Xiao, Pengyu Xu, Liping Jing and Xiangliang Zhang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10685","Multi-label text classification (MLTC) is one of the key tasks in natural language processing. It aims to assign multiple target labels to one document. Due to the uneven popularity of labels, the number of documents per label follows a long-tailed distribution in most cases. It is much more challenging to learn classifiers for data-scarce tail labels than for data-rich head labels. The main reason is that head labels usually have sufficient information, e.g., a large intra-class diversity, while tail labels do not. In response, we propose a Pairwise Instance Relation Augmentation Network (PIRAN) to augment tailed-label documents for balancing tail labels and head labels. PIRAN consists of a relation collector and an instance generator. The former aims to extract the document pairwise relations from head labels. Taking these relations as perturbations, the latter tries to generate new document instances in high-level feature space around the limited given tailed-label instances. Meanwhile, two regularizers (diversity and consistency) are designed to constrain the generation process. The consistency-regularizer encourages the variance of tail labels to be close to head labels and further balances the whole datasets. And diversity-regularizer makes sure the generated instances have diversity and avoids generating redundant instances. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIRAN consistently outperforms the SOTA methods, and dramatically improves the performance of tail labels.","No"

Based on 90K news articles from 52 major newspaper companies, we found that conservative media are inclined to report adverse events more frequently than their liberal counterparts, while the coverage itself was statistically uncorrelated with the severity of real-world adverse events. The users who support the conservative opposing party were more likely to write the popular comments from 2.3K random sampled articles on news platforms.

"Metaphorical Language Change Is Self-Organized Criticality","Xuri Tang and Huifang Ye",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10709","One way to resolve the actuation problem of metaphorical language change is to provide a statistical profile of metaphorical constructions and generative rules with antecedent conditions. Based on arguments from the view of language as complex systems and the dynamic view of metaphor, this paper argues that metaphorical language change qualifies as a self-organized criticality state and the linguistic expressions of a metaphor can be profiled as a fractal with spatio-temporal correlations. Synchronously, these metaphorical expressions self-organize into a self-similar, scale-invariant fractal that follows a power-law distribution; temporally, long range inter-dependence constrains the self-organization process by the way of transformation rules that are intrinsic of a language system. This argument is verified in the paper with statistical analyses of twelve randomly selected Chinese verb metaphors in a large-scale diachronic corpus.","No"

Therefore, MDS approaches which require little to no pretraining, known as few-shot or zero-shot applications, respectively, could be beneficial additions to the current set of tools available in summarization. To explore one possible approach, we devise a strategy for combining state-of-the-art models' outputs using maximal marginal relevance (MMR) with a focus on query relevance rather than document diversity. Our MMR-based approach shows improvement over some aspects of the current state-of-the-art results in both few-shot and zero-shot MDS applications while maintaining a state-of-the-art standard of output by all available metrics.","No"

NNER is where one entity may be part of a longer entity, and this may happen on multiple levels, as the term nested suggests. These nested structures make traditional sequence labeling methods unable to properly recognize all entities. While recent researches focus on designing better recognition methods for NNER in a variety of languages, the Chinese NNER (CNNER) still lacks attention, where a free-for-access, CNNER-specialized benchmark is absent. In this paper, we aim to solve CNNER problems by providing a Chinese dataset and a learning-based model to tackle the issue. To facilitate the research on this task, we release ChiNesE, a CNNER dataset with 20,000 sentences sampled from online passages of multiple domains, containing 117,284 entities failing in 10 categories, where 43.8 percent of those entities are nested. Based on ChiNesE, we propose Mulco, a novel method that can recognize named entities in nested structures through multiple scopes. Each scope use a designed scope-based sequence labeling method, which predicts an anchor and the length of a named entity to recognize it. Experiment results show that Mulco has outperformed several baseline methods with the different recognizing schemes on ChiNesE.

The challenge provides twelve open-sourced base versions of popular language models developed by well-known organizations and twelve fine-tuned language models for text generation. The names and architecture details of fine-tuned models were kept hidden, and participants can access these models only through the rest APIs developed by the organizers. Given these constraints, the goal of the contest is to identify which fine-tuned models originated from which base model. To solve this challenge, we have assumed that fine-tuned models and their corresponding base versions must share a similar vocabulary set with a matching syntactical writing style that resonates in their generated outputs. Our strategy is to develop a set of queries to interrogate base and fine-tuned models. And then perform one-to-many pairing between them based on similarities in their generated responses, where more than one fine-tuned model can pair with a base model but not vice-versa. We have employed four distinct approaches for measuring the resemblance between the responses generated from the models of both sets. The first approach uses evaluation metrics of the machine translation, and the second uses a vector space model. The third approach uses state-of-the-art multi-class text classification, Transformer models. Lastly, the fourth approach uses a set of Transformer based binary text classifiers, one for each provided base model, to perform multi-class text classification in a one-vs-all fashion.

However, most Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) lack synonym knowledge due to inherent limitations of their pre-training objectives such as masked language modeling (MLM). Existing works which inject synonym knowledge into PLMs often suffer from two severe problems: (i) Neglecting the ambiguity of synonyms, and (ii) Undermining semantic understanding of original PLMs, which is caused by inconsistency between the exact semantic similarity of the synonyms and the broad conceptual relevance learned from the original corpus. To address these issues, we propose PICSO, a flexible framework that supports the injection of contextual synonym knowledge from multiple domains into PLMs via a novel entity-aware Adapter which focuses on the semantics of the entities (synonyms) in the contexts. Meanwhile, PICSO stores the synonym knowledge in additional parameters of the Adapter structure, which prevents it from corrupting the semantic understanding of the original PLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICSO can dramatically outperform the original PLMs and the other knowledge and synonym injection models on four different similarity-oriented tasks. In addition, experiments on GLUE prove that PICSO also benefits general natural language understanding tasks. Codes and data will be public.","No"

In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanism of KD on attention recovery of quantized large Transformers. In particular, we reveal that the previously adopted MSE loss on the attention score is insufficient for recovering the self-attention information. Therefore, we propose two KD methods; attention-map and attention-output losses. Furthermore, we explore the unification of both losses to address task-dependent preference between attention-map and output losses.

From the listener's perspective, identifying various affective qualities, such as sarcasm, humour, and emotions, is paramount for comprehending the true connotation of the emitted utterance. However, one of the major hurdles faced in learning these affect dimensions is the presence of figurative language, viz. irony, metaphor, or sarcasm. We hypothesize that any detection system constituting the exhaustive and explicit presentation of the emitted utterance would improve the overall comprehension of the dialogue. To this end, we explore the task of Sarcasm Explanation in Dialogues, which aims to unfold the hidden irony behind sarcastic utterances. We propose MOSES, a deep neural network, which takes a multimodal (sarcastic) dialogue instance as an input and generates a natural language sentence as its explanation. Subsequently, we leverage the generated explanation for various natural language understanding tasks in a conversational dialogue setup, such as sarcasm detection, humour identification, and emotion recognition. Our evaluation shows that MOSES outperforms the state-of-the-art system for SED by an average of ~2% on different evaluation metrics, such as ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR. Further, we observe that leveraging the generated explanation advances three downstream tasks for affect classification - an average improvement of ~14% F1-score in the sarcasm detection task and ~2% in the humour identification and emotion recognition task.

Key principles of DevOps gained more importance and are now applied to security aspects of software development, resulting in the automation of security-enhancing activities. In particular, it is common practice to use automated security testing tools that generate reports after inspecting a software artifact from multiple perspectives. However, this raises the challenge of generating duplicate security findings. To identify these duplicate findings manually, a security expert has to invest resources like time, effort, and knowledge. A partial automation of this process could reduce the analysis effort, encourage DevOps principles, and diminish the chance of human error. In this study, we investigated the potential of applying Natural Language Processing for clustering semantically similar security findings to support the identification of problem-specific duplicate findings. Towards this goal, we developed a web application for annotating and assessing security testing tool reports and published a human-annotated corpus of clustered security findings.

"A Theory of Unsupervised Translation Motivated by Understanding Animal Communication","Shafi Goldwasser, David F. Gruber, Adam Tauman Kalai, Orr Paradise",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11081","Recent years have seen breakthroughs in neural language models that capture nuances of language, culture, and knowledge. Neural networks are capable of translating between languages -- in some cases even between two languages where there is little or no access to parallel translations, in what is known as Unsupervised Machine Translation (UMT). Given this progress, it is intriguing to ask whether machine learning tools can ultimately enable understanding animal communication, particularly that of highly intelligent animals. Our work is motivated by an ambitious interdisciplinary initiative, Project CETI, which is collecting a large corpus of sperm whale communications for machine analysis. We propose a theoretical framework for analyzing UMT when no parallel data are available and when it cannot be assumed that the source and target corpora address related subject domains or posses similar linguistic structure. The framework requires access to a prior probability distribution that should assign non-zero probability to possible translations. We instantiate our framework with two models of language. Our analysis suggests that accuracy of translation depends on the complexity of the source language and the amount of ``common ground'' between the source language and target prior. We also prove upper bounds on the amount of data required from the source language in the unsupervised setting as a function of the amount of data required in a hypothetical supervised setting. Surprisingly, our bounds suggest that the amount of source data required for unsupervised translation is comparable to the supervised setting. For one of the language models which we analyze we also prove a nearly matching lower bound. Our analysis is purely information-theoretic and as such can inform how much source data needs to be collected, but does not yield a computationally efficient procedure.","No"
"Conceptor-Aided Debiasing of Contextualized Embeddings","Yifei Li, Lyle Ungar, Jo\~ao Sedoc",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11087","Pre-trained language models reflect the inherent social biases of their training corpus. Many methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, but they often fail to debias or they sacrifice model accuracy. We use conceptors--a soft projection method--to identify and remove the bias subspace in contextual embeddings in BERT and GPT. We propose two methods of applying conceptors (1) bias subspace projection by post-processing; and (2) a new architecture, conceptor-intervened BERT (CI-BERT), which explicitly incorporates the conceptor projection into all layers during training. We find that conceptor post-processing achieves state-of-the-art debiasing results while maintaining or improving BERT's performance on the GLUE benchmark. Although CI-BERT's training takes all layers' bias into account and can outperform its post-processing counterpart in bias mitigation, CI-BERT reduces the language model accuracy. We also show the importance of carefully constructing the bias subspace. The best results are obtained by removing outliers from the list of biased words, intersecting them (using the conceptor AND operation), and computing their embeddings using the sentences from a cleaner corpus.","No"
"VER: Learning Natural Language Representations for Verbalizing Entities and Relations","Jie Huang, Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11093","Entities and relationships between entities are vital in the real world. Essentially, we understand the world by understanding entities and relations. For instance, to understand a field, e.g., computer science, we need to understand the relevant concepts, e.g., machine learning, and the relationships between concepts, e.g., machine learning and artificial intelligence. To understand a person, we should first know who he/she is and how he/she is related to others. To understand entities and relations, humans may refer to natural language descriptions. For instance, when learning a new scientific term, people usually start by reading its definition in dictionaries or encyclopedias. To know the relationship between two entities, humans tend to create a sentence to connect them. In this paper, we propose VER: A Unified Model for Verbalizing Entities and Relations. Specifically, we attempt to build a system that takes any entity or entity set as input and generates a sentence to represent entities and relations, named ``natural language representation''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model can generate high-quality sentences describing entities and entity relationships and facilitate various tasks on entities and relations, including definition modeling, relation modeling, and generative commonsense reasoning.","No"

Prediction models may discover, use, or amplify spurious correlations based on gender or other protected personal characteristics, thus discriminating against marginalized groups. Mitigating gender bias has become an important research focus in natural language processing (NLP) and is an area where annotated corpora are available. Data augmentation reduces gender bias by adding counterfactual examples to the training dataset. In this work, we show that some of the examples in the augmented dataset can be not important or even harmful for fairness. We hence propose a general method for pruning both the factual and counterfactual examples to maximize the model's fairness as measured by the demographic parity, equality of opportunity, and equality of odds. The fairness achieved by our method surpasses that of data augmentation on three text classification datasets, using no more than half of the examples in the augmented dataset.

Among them, explaining the reason why a statement is wrong (e.g., against commonsense) is incredibly challenging. The major difficulty is finding the conflict point, where the statement contradicts our real world. This paper proposes Neon, a two-phrase, unsupervised explanation generation framework. Neon first generates corrected instantiations of the statement (phase I), then uses them to prompt large PLMs to find the conflict point and complete the explanation (phase II). We conduct extensive experiments on two standard explanation benchmarks, i.e., ComVE and e-SNLI. According to both automatic and human evaluations, Neon outperforms baselines, even for those with human-annotated instantiations. In addition to explaining a negative prediction, we further demonstrate that Neon remains effective when generalizing to different scenarios.","No"

Sentence-BERT models specifically trained on STS or NLI datasets are shown to provide state-of-the-art performance. However, building these models for low-resource languages is not straightforward due to the lack of these specialized datasets. This work focuses on two low-resource Indian languages, Hindi and Marathi. We train sentence-BERT models for these languages using synthetic NLI and STS datasets prepared using machine translation. We show that the strategy of NLI pre-training followed by STSb fine-tuning is effective in generating high-performance sentence-similarity models for Hindi and Marathi. The vanilla BERT models trained using this simple strategy outperform the multilingual LaBSE trained using a complex training strategy. These models are evaluated on downstream text classification and similarity tasks. We evaluate these models on real text classification datasets to show embeddings obtained from synthetic data training are generalizable to real datasets as well and thus represent an effective training strategy for low-resource languages. We also provide a comparative analysis of sentence embeddings from fast text models, multilingual BERT models (mBERT, IndicBERT, xlm-RoBERTa, MuRIL), multilingual sentence embedding models (LASER, LaBSE), and monolingual BERT models based on L3Cube-MahaBERT and HindBERT.

When confronted with a stream of tasks common in real-world applications, existing methods struggle with the problems of insufficient supervised data and high retraining costs. The former tends to cause overfitting on unseen databases for the new task, while the latter makes a full review of instances from past tasks impractical for the model, resulting in forgetting of learned SQL structures and database schemas. To address the problems, this paper proposes integrating semi-supervised learning (SSL) and continual learning (CL) in a stream of text-to-SQL tasks and offers two promising solutions in turn. The first solution Vanilla is to perform self-training, augmenting the supervised training data with predicted pseudo-labeled instances of the current task, while replacing the full volume retraining with episodic memory replay to balance the training efficiency with the performance of previous tasks. The improved solution SFNet takes advantage of the intrinsic connection between CL and SSL. It uses in-memory past information to help current SSL, while adding high-quality pseudo instances in memory to improve future replay. The experiments on two datasets shows that SFNet outperforms the widely-used SSL-only and CL-only baselines on multiple metrics.","No"

In this paper, we propose a multimodal sentiment knowledge-sharing framework (UniMSE) that unifies MSA and ERC tasks from features, labels, and models. We perform modality fusion at the syntactic and semantic levels and introduce contrastive learning between modalities and samples to better capture the difference and consistency between sentiments and emotions.

These approaches either train a language model from scratch or fine-tune a pre-trained language model using ID examples, and then take perplexity as output by the language model as OoD scores. In this paper, we analyse the complementary characteristics of both OoD detection methods and propose a multi-level knowledge distillation approach to integrate their strengths, while mitigating their limitations. Specifically, we use a fine-tuned model as the teacher to teach a randomly initialized student model on the ID examples. Besides the prediction layer distillation, we present a similarity-based intermediate layer distillation method to facilitate the student's awareness of the information flow inside the teacher's layers. In this way, the derived student model gains the teacher's rich knowledge about the ID data manifold due to pre-training, while benefiting from seeing only ID examples during parameter learning, which promotes more distinguishable features for OoD detection. We conduct extensive experiments over multiple benchmark datasets, i.e., CLINC150, SST, 20 NewsGroups, and AG News; showing that the proposed method yields new state-of-the-art performance.","No"

However, here we take the position that such a language model cannot be sentient, or conscious, and that LaMDA in particular exhibits no advances over other similar models that would qualify it. We justify this by analysing the Transformer architecture through Integrated Information Theory.

Particularly, random-LTD achieves considerable speedups and comparable accuracy as the standard training baseline. Compared to other token dropping methods, random-LTD does not require (1) any importance score-based metrics, (2) any special token treatment (e.g., [CLS]), and (3) many layers in full sequence length training except the first and the last layers. Besides, a new LayerToken learning rate schedule is proposed for pretraining problems that resolve the heavy tuning requirement for our proposed training mechanism.

"SeDR: Segment Representation Learning for Long Documents Dense Retrieval","Junying Chen, Qingcai Chen, Dongfang Li, Yutao Huang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10841","Recently, Dense Retrieval (DR) has become a promising solution to document retrieval, where document representations are used to perform effective and efficient semantic search. However, DR remains challenging on long documents, due to the quadratic complexity of its Transformer-based encoder and the finite capacity of a low-dimension embedding. Current DR models use suboptimal strategies such as truncating or splitting-and-pooling to long documents leading to poor utilization of whole document information. In this work, to tackle this problem, we propose Segment representation learning for long documents Dense Retrieval (SeDR). In SeDR, Segment-Interaction Transformer is proposed to encode long documents into document-aware and segment-sensitive representations, while it holds the complexity of splitting-and-pooling and outperforms other segment-interaction patterns on DR. Since GPU memory requirements for long document encoding causes insufficient negatives for DR training, Late-Cache Negative is further proposed to provide additional cache negatives for optimizing representation learning. Experiments on MS MARCO and TREC-DL datasets show that SeDR achieves superior performance among DR models, and confirm the effectiveness of SeDR on long document retrieval.","No"

In this paper, we study a new problem of cross-modal sarcasm generation (CMSG), i.e., generating a sarcastic description for a given image. CMSG is challenging as models need to satisfy the characteristics of sarcasm, as well as the correlation between different modalities. In addition, there should be some inconsistency between the two modalities, which requires imagination. Moreover, high-quality training data is insufficient. To address these problems, we take a step toward generating sarcastic descriptions from images without paired training data and propose an Extraction-Generation-Ranking based Modular method (EGRM) for cross-model sarcasm generation. Specifically, EGRM first extracts diverse information from an image at different levels and uses the obtained image tags, sentimental descriptive caption, and commonsense-based consequence to generate candidate sarcastic texts. Then, a comprehensive ranking algorithm, which considers image-text relation, sarcasticness, and grammaticality, is proposed to select a final text from the candidate texts. Human evaluation at five criteria on a total of 1200 generated image-text pairs from eight systems and auxiliary automatic evaluation show the superiority of our method.","No"
"You Need Multiple Exiting: Dynamic Early Exiting for Accelerating Unified Vision Language Model","Shengkun Tang, Yaqing Wang, Zhenglun Kong, Tianchi Zhang, Yao Li, Caiwen Ding, Yanzhi Wang, Yi Liang, Dongkuan Xu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11152","Large-scale Transformer models bring significant improvements for various downstream vision language tasks with a unified architecture. The performance improvements come with increasing model size, resulting in slow inference speed and increased cost for severing. While some certain predictions benefit from the full complexity of the large-scale model, not all of inputs need the same amount of computation to conduct, potentially leading to computation resource waste. To handle this challenge, early exiting is proposed to adaptively allocate computational power in term of input complexity to improve inference efficiency. The existing early exiting strategies usually adopt output confidence based on intermediate layers as a proxy of input complexity to incur the decision of skipping following layers. However, such strategies cannot apply to encoder in the widely-used unified architecture with both encoder and decoder due to difficulty of output confidence estimation in the encoder. It is suboptimal in term of saving computation power to ignore the early exiting in encoder component. To handle this challenge, we propose a novel early exiting strategy for unified visual language models, which allows dynamically skip the layers in encoder and decoder simultaneously in term of input layer-wise similarities with multiple times of early exiting, namely \textbf{MuE}. By decomposing the image and text modalities in the encoder, MuE is flexible and can skip different layers in term of modalities, advancing the inference efficiency while minimizing performance drop. Experiments on the SNLI-VE and MS COCO datasets show that the proposed approach MuE can reduce expected inference time by up to 50\% and 40\% while maintaining 99\% and 96\% performance respectively.","No"

We first identify difficulties in learning a generic one-tower model for vision-language pretraining (VLP), and propose OneR as a simple yet effective framework for our goal. We discover intriguing properties that distinguish OneR from the previous works that learn modality-specific representation spaces such as zero-shot object localization, text-guided visual reasoning and multi-modal retrieval, and present analyses to provide insights into this new form of multi-modal representation learning.

They allow people to easily understand why a model is failing, a critical feature for high-stakes applications. CBMs require manually specified concepts and often under-perform their black box counterparts, preventing their broad adoption. We address these shortcomings and are first to show how to construct high-performance CBMs without manual specification of similar accuracy to black box models. Our approach, Language Guided Bottlenecks (LaBo), leverages a language model, GPT-3, to define a large space of possible bottlenecks. Given a problem domain, LaBo uses GPT-3 to produce factual sentences about categories to form candidate concepts. LaBo efficiently searches possible bottlenecks through a novel submodular utility that promotes the selection of discriminative and diverse information. Ultimately, GPT-3's sentential concepts can be aligned to images using CLIP, to form a bottleneck layer. Experiments demonstrate that LaBo is a highly effective prior for concepts important to visual recognition. In the evaluation with 11 diverse datasets, LaBo bottlenecks excel at few-shot classification: they are 11.7% more accurate than black box linear probes at 1 shot and comparable with more data. Overall, LaBo demonstrates that inherently interpretable models can be widely applied at similar, or better, performance than black box approaches.","No"

An intuitive solution to this problem is to leverage pre-trained models from other modalities (e.g., natural language) to improve the performance of symbolic music-related multimodal tasks. In this paper, we carry out the first study of generating complete and semantically consistent symbolic music scores from text descriptions, and explore the efficacy of using publicly available checkpoints (i.e., BERT, GPT-2, and BART) for natural language processing in the task of text-to-music generation. Our experimental results show that the improvement from using pre-trained checkpoints is statistically significant in terms of BLEU score and edit distance similarity. We analyse the capabilities and limitations of our model to better understand the potential of language-music models.","No"

How to design a unified framework to integrate different modal information and leverage different resources (e.g., visual-audio pairs, audio-text pairs, unlabeled speech, and unlabeled text) to facilitate speech representation learning was not well explored. In this paper, we propose a unified cross-modal representation learning framework VATLM (Visual-Audio-Text Language Model). The proposed VATLM employs a unified backbone network to model the modality-independent information and utilizes three simple modality-dependent modules to preprocess visual, speech, and text inputs. In order to integrate these three modalities into one shared semantic space, VATLM is optimized with a masked prediction task of unified tokens, given by our proposed unified tokenizer.

However, they are often overwhelmed by words of new concepts, styles, or object entities that always emerge. Although there are some recent attempts to use fine-tuning or prompt-tuning methods to teach the model a new concept as a new pseudo-word from a given reference image set, these methods are not only still difficult to synthesize diverse and high-quality images without distortion and artifacts, but also suffer from low controllability. To address these problems, we propose a DreamArtist method that employs a learning strategy of contrastive prompt-tuning, which introduces both positive and negative embeddings as pseudo-words and trains them jointly. The positive embedding aggressively learns characteristics in the reference image to drive the model diversified generation, while the negative embedding introspects in a self-supervised manner to rectify the mistakes and inadequacies from positive embedding in reverse. It learns not only what is correct but also what should be avoided. Extensive experiments on image quality and diversity analysis, controllability analysis, model learning analysis and task expansion have demonstrated that our model learns not only concept but also form, content and context. Pseudo-words of DreamArtist have similar properties as true words to generate high-quality images.","No"

In order to address this issue, various Link Prediction (LP) methods are proposed so far. Some of these methods are inductive LP models which are capable of learning representations for entities not seen during training. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing inductive LP models focus on learning representations for unseen relations. In this work, a novel Relation Aware Inductive Link preDiction (RAILD) is proposed for KG completion which learns representations for both unseen entities and unseen relations. In addition to leveraging textual literals associated with both entities and relations by employing language models, RAILD also introduces a novel graph-based approach to generate features for relations. Experiments are conducted with different existing and newly created challenging benchmark datasets and the results indicate that RAILD leads to performance improvement over the state-of-the-art models. Moreover, since there are no existing inductive LP models which learn representations for unseen relations, we have created our own baselines and the results obtained with RAILD also outperform these baselines.","No"

Different from prior works which only mask textual inputs, our masking strategy considers both visual and textual modalities, providing a better cross-modal alignment and saving more pre-training costs. On top of that, we introduce a space-time token sparsification module, which leverages context information to further select only 'important' spatial regions and temporal frames for pre-training. Coupling all these designs allows our method to enjoy both competitive performances on text-to-video retrieval and video question answering tasks, and much less pre-training costs by 1.9X or more. For example, our SMAUG only needs about 50 NVIDIA A6000 GPU hours for pre-training to attain competitive performances on these two video-language tasks across six popular benchmarks.","No"

"Detect Only What You Specify : Object Detection with Linguistic Target","Moyuru Yamada",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11572","Object detection is a computer vision task of predicting a set of bounding boxes and category labels for each object of interest in a given image. The category is related to a linguistic symbol such as 'dog' or 'person' and there should be relationships among them. However the object detector only learns to classify the categories and does not treat them as the linguistic symbols. Multi-modal models often use the pre-trained object detector to extract object features from the image, but the models are separated from the detector and the extracted visual features does not change with their linguistic input. We rethink the object detection as a vision-and-language reasoning task. We then propose targeted detection task, where detection targets are given by a natural language and the goal of the task is to detect only all the target objects in a given image. There are no detection if the target is not given. Commonly used modern object detectors have many hand-designed components like anchor and it is difficult to fuse the textual inputs into the complex pipeline. We thus propose Language-Targeted Detector (LTD) for the targeted detection based on a recently proposed Transformer-based detector. LTD is a encoder-decoder architecture and our conditional decoder allows the model to reason about the encoded image with the textual input as the linguistic context. We evaluate detection performances of LTD on COCO object detection dataset and also show that our model improves the detection results with the textual input grounding to the visual object.","No"

However, existing approaches usually consider learning prompt vectors for each task independently from scratch, thereby failing to exploit the rich shareable knowledge across different vision-language tasks. In this paper, we propose multitask vision-language prompt tuning (MVLPT), which incorporates cross-task knowledge into prompt tuning for vision-language models. Specifically, (i) we demonstrate the effectiveness of learning a single transferable prompt from multiple source tasks to initialize the prompt for each target task; (ii) we show many target tasks can benefit each other from sharing prompt vectors and thus can be jointly learned via multitask prompt tuning. We benchmark the proposed MVLPT using three representative prompt tuning methods, namely text prompt tuning, visual prompt tuning, and the unified vision-language prompt tuning. Results in 20 vision tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms all single-task baseline prompt tuning methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on the few-shot ELEVATER benchmarks and cross-task generalization benchmarks.

However, the limited availability of labeled sexism-related datasets makes it problematic to identify online sexism for low-resource languages. In this paper, we address the task of automatic sexism detection in social media for one low-resource language -- Chinese. Rather than collecting new sexism data or building cross-lingual transfer learning models, we develop a cross-lingual domain-aware semantic specialisation system in order to make the most of existing data. Semantic specialisation is a technique for retrofitting pre-trained distributional word vectors by integrating external linguistic knowledge (such as lexico-semantic relations) into the specialised feature space. To do this, we leverage semantic resources for sexism from a high-resource language (English) to specialise pre-trained word vectors in the target language (Chinese) to inject domain knowledge. We demonstrate the benefit of our sexist word embeddings (SexWEs) specialised by our framework via intrinsic evaluation of word similarity and extrinsic evaluation of sexism detection. Compared with other specialisation approaches and Chinese baseline word vectors, our SexWEs shows an average score improvement of 0.033 and 0.064 in both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, respectively. The ablative results and visualisation of SexWEs also prove the effectiveness of our framework on retrofitting word vectors in low-resource languages.

Consequently, numerous bias detection methods have been proposed, which vary in their approach, the considered type of bias, and the data used for evaluation. However, while most detection methods are derived from the word embedding association test for static word embeddings, the reported results are heterogeneous, inconsistent, and ultimately inconclusive. To address this issue, we conduct a rigorous analysis and comparison of bias detection methods for contextual language models. Our results show that minor design and implementation decisions (or errors) have a substantial and often significant impact on the derived bias scores. Overall, we find the state of the field to be both worse than previously acknowledged due to systematic and propagated errors in implementations, yet better than anticipated since divergent results in the literature homogenize after accounting for implementation errors. Based on our findings, we conclude with a discussion of paths towards more robust and consistent bias detection methods.","No"

While studies have attempted to understand transfer, they focus only on MLM, and the large number of differences between natural languages makes it hard to disentangle the importance of different properties. In this work, we specifically highlight the importance of word embedding alignment by proposing a pre-training objective (ALIGN-MLM) whose auxiliary loss guides similar words in different languages to have similar word embeddings. ALIGN-MLM either outperforms or matches three widely adopted objectives (MLM, XLM, DICT-MLM) when we evaluate transfer between pairs of natural languages and their counterparts created by systematically modifying specific properties like the script. In particular, ALIGN-MLM outperforms XLM and MLM by 35 and 30 F1 points on POS-tagging for transfer between languages that differ both in their script and word order (left-to-right v.s. right-to-left). We also show a strong correlation between alignment and transfer for all objectives (e.g., rho=0.727 for XNLI), which together with ALIGN-MLM's strong performance calls for explicitly aligning word embeddings for multilingual models.","No"

Given the Findings and/or Background sections of a radiology report, the goal is to generate a summary (called an Impression section) that highlights the key observations and conclusions of the radiology study. Recent efforts have released systems that achieve promising performance as measured by widely used summarization metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE. However, the research area of radiology report summarization currently faces important limitations. First, most of the results are reported on private datasets. This limitation prevents the ability to reproduce results and fairly compare different systems and solutions. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, most research is carried out on chest X-rays. Sometimes, studies even omit to mention the concerned modality and anatomy in the radiology reports used for their experiments. To palliate these limitations, we propose a new dataset of six different modalities and anatomies based on the MIMIC-III database. We further release our results and the data splits used to carry out our experiments. Finally, we propose a simple report summarization system that outperforms the previous replicable research on the existing dataset.","No"
"Disentangling Task Relations for Few-shot Text Classification via Self-Supervised Hierarchical Task Clustering","Juan Zha, Zheng Li, Ying Wei, Yu Zhang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08588","Few-Shot Text Classification (FSTC) imitates humans to learn a new text classifier efficiently with only few examples, by leveraging prior knowledge from historical tasks. However, most prior works assume that all the tasks are sampled from a single data source, which cannot adapt to real-world scenarios where tasks are heterogeneous and lie in different distributions. As such, existing methods may suffer from their globally knowledge-shared mechanisms to handle the task heterogeneity. On the other hand, inherent task relation are not explicitly captured, making task knowledge unorganized and hard to transfer to new tasks. Thus, we explore a new FSTC setting where tasks can come from a diverse range of data sources. To address the task heterogeneity, we propose a self-supervised hierarchical task clustering (SS-HTC) method. SS-HTC not only customizes cluster-specific knowledge by dynamically organizing heterogeneous tasks into different clusters in hierarchical levels but also disentangles underlying relations between tasks to improve the interpretability. Extensive experiments on five public FSTC benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SS-HTC.","No"
"MT Metrics Correlate with Human Ratings of Simultaneous Speech Translation","Dominik Mach\'a\v{c}ek, Ond\v{r}ej Bojar, Raj Dabre",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08633","There have been several studies on the correlation between human ratings and metrics such as BLEU, chrF2 and COMET in machine translation. Most, if not all consider full-sentence translation. It is unclear whether human ratings of simultaneous speech translation Continuous Rating (CR) correlate with these metrics or not. Therefore, we conduct an extensive correlation analysis of CR and the aforementioned automatic metrics on evaluations of candidate systems at English-German simultaneous speech translation task at IWSLT 2022. Our studies reveal that the offline MT metrics correlate with CR and can be reliably used for evaluating machine translation in the simultaneous mode, with some limitations on the test set size. This implies that automatic metrics can be used as proxies for CR, thereby alleviating the need for human evaluation.","No"
"#maskUp: Selective Attribute Encryption for Sensitive Vocalization for English language on Social Media Platforms","Supriti Vijay and Aman Priyanshu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08653","Social media has become a platform for people to stand up and raise their voices against social and criminal acts. Vocalization of such information has allowed the investigation and identification of criminals. However, revealing such sensitive information may jeopardize the victim's safety. We propose #maskUp, a safe method for information communication in a secure fashion to the relevant authorities, discouraging potential bullying of the victim. This would ensure security by conserving their privacy through natural language processing supplemented with selective encryption for sensitive attribute masking. To our knowledge, this is the first work that aims to protect the privacy of the victims by masking their private details as well as emboldening them to come forward to report crimes. The use of masking technology allows only binding authorities to view/un-mask this data. We construct and evaluate the proposed methodology on continual learning tasks, allowing practical implementation of the same in a real-world scenario. #maskUp successfully demonstrates this integration on sample datasets validating the presented objective.","No"
"Parameter-Efficient Tuning on Layer Normalization for Pre-trained Language Models","Wang Qi, Yu-Ping Ruan, Yuan Zuo, Taihao Li",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08682","Conventional fine-tuning encounters increasing difficulties given the size of current Pre-trained Language Models, which makes parameter-efficient tuning become the focal point of frontier research. Previous methods in this field add tunable adapters into MHA or/and FFN of Transformer blocks to enable PLMs achieve transferability. However, as an important part of Transformer architecture, the power of layer normalization for parameter-efficent tuning is ignored. In this paper, we first propose LN-tuning, by tuning the gain and bias term of Layer Normalization module with only 0.03\% parameters, which is of high time-efficency and significantly superior to baselines which are less than 0.1\% tunable parameters. Further, we study the unified framework of combining LN-tuning with previous ones and we find that: (1) the unified framework of combining prefix-tuning, the adapter-based method working on MHA, and LN-tuning achieves SOTA performance. (2) unified framework which tunes MHA and LayerNorm simultaneously can get performance improvement but those which tune FFN and LayerNorm simultaneous will cause performance decrease. Ablation study validates LN-tuning is of no abundant parameters and gives a further understanding of it.","No"

Previous work in this domain used expectation-maximization to predict simple phonological changes between ancient word forms and their cognates in modern languages. We extend this work with neural models that can capture more complicated phonological and morphological changes. At the same time, we preserve the inductive biases from classical methods by building monotonic alignment constraints into the model and deliberately underfitting during the maximization step. We evaluate our performance on the task of reconstructing Latin from a dataset of cognates across five Romance languages, achieving a notable reduction in edit distance from the target word forms compared to previous methods.","No"
"Reward Gaming in Conditional Text Generation","Richard Yuanzhe Pang, Vishakh Padmakumar, Thibault Sellam, Ankur P. Parikh, He He",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08714","To align conditional text generation model outputs with desired behaviors, there has been an increasing focus on training the model using reinforcement learning (RL) with reward functions learned from human annotations. Under this framework, we identify three common cases where high rewards are incorrectly assigned to undesirable patterns: noise-induced spurious correlation, naturally occurring spurious correlation, and covariate shift. We show that even though learned metrics achieve high performance on the distribution of the data used to train the reward function, the undesirable patterns may be amplified during RL training of the text generation model. While there has been discussion about reward gaming in the RL or safety community, in this short discussion piece, we would like to highlight reward gaming in the NLG community using concrete conditional text generation examples and discuss potential fixes and areas for future work.","No"
"Noisy Pairing and Partial Supervision for Opinion Summarization","Hayate Iso and Xiaolan Wang and Yoshi Suhara",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08723","Current opinion summarization systems simply generate summaries reflecting important opinions from customer reviews, but the generated summaries may not attract the reader's attention. Although it is helpful to automatically generate professional reviewer-like summaries from customer reviews, collecting many training pairs of customer and professional reviews is generally tricky. We propose a weakly supervised opinion summarization framework, Noisy Pairing and Partial Supervision (NAPA) that can build a stylized opinion summarization system with no customer-professional review pairs. Experimental results show consistent improvements in automatic evaluation metrics, and qualitative analysis shows that our weakly supervised opinion summarization system can generate summaries that look more like those written by professional reviewers.","No"
"Streaming Joint Speech Recognition and Disfluency Detection","Hayato Futami, Emiru Tsunoo, Kentaro Shibata, Yosuke Kashiwagi, Takao Okuda, Siddhant Arora, Shinji Watanabe",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08726","Disfluency detection has mainly been solved in a pipeline approach, as post-processing of speech recognition. In this study, we propose Transformer-based encoder-decoder models that jointly solve speech recognition and disfluency detection, which work in a streaming manner. Compared to pipeline approaches, the joint models can leverage acoustic information that makes disfluency detection robust to recognition errors and provide non-verbal clues. Moreover, joint modeling results in low-latency and lightweight inference. We investigate two joint model variants for streaming disfluency detection: a transcript-enriched model and a multi-task model. The transcript-enriched model is trained on text with special tags indicating the starting and ending points of the disfluent part. However, it has problems with latency and standard language model adaptation, which arise from the additional disfluency tags. We propose a multi-task model to solve such problems, which has two output layers at the Transformer decoder; one for speech recognition and the other for disfluency detection. It is modeled to be conditioned on the currently recognized token with an additional token-dependency mechanism. We show that the proposed joint models outperformed a BERT-based pipeline approach in both accuracy and latency, on both the Switchboard and the corpus of spontaneous Japanese.","No"
"RetroMAE v2: Duplex Masked Auto-Encoder For Pre-Training Retrieval-Oriented Language Models","Shitao Xiao, Zheng Liu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08769","To better support retrieval applications such as web search and question answering, growing effort is made to develop retrieval-oriented language models. Most of the existing works focus on improving the semantic representation capability for the contextualized embedding of [CLS] token. However, recent study shows that the ordinary tokens besides [CLS] may provide extra information, which helps to produce a better representation effect. As such, it's necessary to extend the current methods where all contextualized embeddings can be jointly pre-trained for the retrieval tasks. With this motivation, we propose a new pre-training method: duplex masked auto-encoder, a.k.a. DupMAE, which targets on improving the semantic representation capacity for the contextualized embeddings of both [CLS] and ordinary tokens. It introduces two decoding tasks: one is to reconstruct the original input sentence based on the [CLS] embedding, the other one is to minimize the bag-of-words loss (BoW) about the input sentence based on the entire ordinary tokens' embeddings. The two decoding losses are added up to train a unified encoding model. The embeddings from [CLS] and ordinary tokens, after dimension reduction and aggregation, are concatenated as one unified semantic representation for the input. DupMAE is simple but empirically competitive: with a small decoding cost, it substantially contributes to the model's representation capability and transferability, where remarkable improvements are achieved on MS MARCO and BEIR benchmarks.","No"
"CSCD-IME: Correcting Spelling Errors Generated by Pinyin IME","Yong Hu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08788","Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) is a task to detect and correct spelling mistakes in texts. In fact, most of Chinese input is based on pinyin input method, so the study of spelling errors in this process is more practical and valuable. However, there is still no research dedicated to this essential scenario. In this paper, we first present a Chinese Spelling Correction Dataset for errors generated by pinyin IME (CSCD-IME), including 40,000 annotated sentences from real posts of official media on Sina Weibo. Furthermore, we propose a novel method to automatically construct large-scale and high-quality pseudo data by simulating the input through pinyin IME. A series of analyses and experiments on CSCD-IME show that spelling errors produced by pinyin IME hold a particular distribution at pinyin level and semantic level and are challenging enough. Meanwhile, our proposed pseudo-data construction method can better fit this error distribution and improve the performance of CSC systems. Finally, we also provide a useful guide to using pseudo data, including the data scale, the data source, and the training strategy","No"

In this work, we present a novel method that operates on the hidden representations of a PLM to reduce overfitting. During fine-tuning, our method inserts random autoencoders between the hidden layers of a PLM, which transform activations from the previous layers into a multi-view compressed representation before feeding it into the upper layers. The autoencoders are plugged out after fine-tuning, so our method does not add extra parameters or increase computation cost during inference. Our method demonstrates promising performance improvement across a wide range of sequence- and token-level low-resource NLP tasks.","No"
"Cognitive Simplification Operations Improve Text Simplification","Eytan Chamovitz and Omri Abend",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08825","Text Simplification (TS) is the task of converting a text into a form that is easier to read while maintaining the meaning of the original text. A sub-task of TS is Cognitive Simplification (CS), converting text to a form that is readily understood by people with cognitive disabilities without rendering it childish or simplistic. This sub-task has yet to be explored with neural methods in NLP, and resources for it are scarcely available. In this paper, we present a method for incorporating knowledge from the cognitive accessibility domain into a TS model, by introducing an inductive bias regarding what simplification operations to use. We show that by adding this inductive bias to a TS-trained model, it is able to adapt better to CS without ever seeing CS data, and outperform a baseline model on a traditional TS benchmark. In addition, we provide a novel test dataset for CS, and analyze the differences between CS corpora and existing TS corpora, in terms of how simplification operations are applied.","No"
"Fast and Accurate FSA System Using ELBERT: An Efficient and Lightweight BERT","Siyuan Lu, Chenchen Zhou, Keli Xie, Shiyi Liu, Jun Lin, and Zhongfeng Wang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08842","As an application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, financial sentiment analysis (FSA) has become an invaluable tool for investors. Its speed and accuracy can significantly impact the returns of trading strategies.With the development of deep learning and Transformer-based pre-trained models like BERT, the accuracy of FSA has been much improved, but these time-consuming big models will also slow down the computation. To boost the processing speed of the FSA system and ensure high precision, we first propose an efficient and lightweight BERT (ELBERT) along with a novel confidence-window-based (CWB) early exit mechanism. Based on ELBERT, an innovative method to accelerate text processing on the GPU platform is developed, solving the difficult problem of making the early exit mechanism work more effectively with a large input batch size. Afterward, a fast and high-accuracy FSA system is built. Experimental results show that the proposed CWB early exit mechanism achieves significantly higher accuracy than existing early exit methods on BERT under the same computation cost. Besides, our FSA system can boost the processing speed to over 1000 texts per second with sufficient accuracy by using this acceleration method, which is nearly twice as fast as the FastBERT. Hence, this system can enable modern trading systems to quickly and accurately process financial text data.","No"
"Consecutive Question Generation via Dynamic Multitask Learning","Yunji Li, Sujian Li, Xing Shi",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08850","In this paper, we propose the task of consecutive question generation (CQG), which generates a set of logically related question-answer pairs to understand a whole passage, with a comprehensive consideration of the aspects including accuracy, coverage, and informativeness. To achieve this, we first examine the four key elements of CQG, i.e., question, answer, rationale, and context history, and propose a novel dynamic multitask framework with one main task generating a question-answer pair, and four auxiliary tasks generating other elements. It directly helps the model generate good questions through both joint training and self-reranking. At the same time, to fully explore the worth-asking information in a given passage, we make use of the reranking losses to sample the rationales and search for the best question series globally. Finally, we measure our strategy by QA data augmentation and manual evaluation, as well as a novel application of generated question-answer pairs on DocNLI. We prove that our strategy can improve question generation significantly and benefit multiple related NLP tasks.","No"

"Avoid Overthinking in Self-Supervised Models for Speech Recognition","Dan Berrebbi and Brian Yan and Shinji Watanabe",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08989","Self-supervised learning (SSL) models reshaped our approach to speech, language and vision. However their huge size and the opaque relations between their layers and tasks result in slow inference and network overthinking, where predictions made from the last layer of large models is worse than those made from intermediate layers. Early exit (EE) strategies can solve both issues by dynamically reducing computations at inference time for certain samples. Although popular for classification tasks in vision and language, EE has seen less use for sequence-to-sequence speech recognition (ASR) tasks where outputs from early layers are often degenerate. This challenge is further compounded when speech SSL models are applied on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This paper first shows that SSL models do overthinking in ASR. We then motivate further research in EE by computing an optimal bound for performance versus speed trade-offs. To approach this bound we propose two new strategies for ASR: (1) we adapt the recently proposed patience strategy to ASR; and (2) we design a new EE strategy specific to ASR that performs better than all strategies previously introduced.","No"

Therefore, the rich correlations are not fully exploited by existing works. In this paper, we propose UniRel to address these challenges. Specifically, we unify the representations of entities and relations by jointly encoding them within a concatenated natural language sequence, and unify the modeling of interactions with a proposed Interaction Map, which is built upon the off-the-shelf self-attention mechanism within any Transformer block.

It embeds the LM in an auto-encoder by feeding its output to a semantic parser whose output is in the same representation domain as the input message. Compared to a baseline that generates text using greedy search, we demonstrate two techniques that improve the fluency and semantic accuracy of the generated text: The first technique samples multiple candidate text sequences from which the semantic parser chooses. The second trains the language model while keeping the semantic parser frozen to improve the semantic accuracy of the auto-encoder. We carry out experiments on the English WebNLG 3.0 data set, using BLEU to measure the fluency of generated text and standard parsing metrics to measure semantic accuracy. We show that our proposed approaches significantly improve on the greedy search baseline. Human evaluation corroborates the results of the automatic evaluation experiments.","No"

We train on a large scientific corpus of papers, reference material, knowledge bases and many other sources. We outperform existing models on a range of scientific tasks. On technical knowledge probes such as LaTeX equations, Galactica outperforms the latest GPT-3 by 68.2% versus 49.0%.

We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to improve the transparency of language models. First, we taxonomize the vast space of potential scenarios (i.e. use cases) and metrics (i.e. desiderata) that are of interest for LMs. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage and feasibility, noting what's missing or underrepresented (e.g. question answering for neglected English dialects, metrics for trustworthiness). Second, we adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core scenarios when possible (87.5% of the time). This ensures metrics beyond accuracy don't fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs are clearly exposed. We also perform 7 targeted evaluations, based on 26 targeted scenarios, to analyze specific aspects (e.g. reasoning, disinformation). Third, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of 30 prominent language models (spanning open, limited-access, and closed models) on all 42 scenarios, 21 of which were not previously used in mainstream LM evaluation. Prior to HELM, models on average were evaluated on just 17.9% of the core HELM scenarios, with some prominent models not sharing a single scenario in common. We improve this to 96.0%: now all 30 models have been densely benchmarked on the same core scenarios and metrics under standardized conditions. Our evaluation surfaces 25 top-level findings. For full transparency, we release all raw model prompts and completions publicly for further analysis, as well as a general modular toolkit.

"On Measuring the Intrinsic Few-Shot Hardness of Datasets","Xinran Zhao, Shikhar Murty, Christopher D. Manning",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09113","While advances in pre-training have led to dramatic improvements in few-shot learning of NLP tasks, there is limited understanding of what drives successful few-shot adaptation in datasets.

We consider an extensive set of recent few-shot learning methods, and show that their performance across a large number of datasets is highly correlated, showing that few-shot hardness may be intrinsic to datasets, for a given pre-trained model. To estimate intrinsic few-shot hardness, we then propose a simple and lightweight metric called 'Spread' that captures the intuition that few-shot learning is made possible by exploiting feature-space invariances between training and test samples. Our metric better accounts for few-shot hardness compared to existing notions of hardness, and is ~8-100x faster to compute.","No"

These maps are human-readable but are often challenging to deal with when trying to extract data for screen readers, analyses, or other related tasks. Recent research into Visual-Question Answering (VQA) has studied question answering on human-generated charts (ChartQA), such as bar, line, and pie charts. However, little work has paid attention to understanding maps; general VQA models, and ChartQA models, suffer when asked to perform this task. To facilitate and encourage research in this area, we present MapQA, a large-scale dataset of ~800K question-answer pairs over ~60K map images. Our task tests various levels of map understanding, from surface questions about map styles to complex questions that require reasoning on the underlying data. We present the unique challenges of MapQA that frustrate most strong baseline algorithms designed for ChartQA and general VQA tasks. We also present a novel algorithm, Visual Multi-Output Data Extraction based QA (V-MODEQA) for MapQA. V-MODEQA extracts the underlying structured data from a map image with a multi-output model and then performs reasoning on the extracted data. Our experimental results show that V-MODEQA has better overall performance and robustness on MapQA than the state-of-the-art ChartQA and VQA algorithms by capturing the unique properties in map question answering.","No"
"Lesion Guided Explainable Few Weak-shot Medical Report Generation","Jinghan Sun, Dong Wei, Liansheng Wang, and Yefeng Zheng",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08732","Medical images are widely used in clinical practice for diagnosis. Automatically generating interpretable medical reports can reduce radiologists' burden and facilitate timely care. However, most existing approaches to automatic report generation require sufficient labeled data for training. In addition, the learned model can only generate reports for the training classes, lacking the ability to adapt to previously unseen novel diseases. To this end, we propose a lesion guided explainable few weak-shot medical report generation framework that learns correlation between seen and novel classes through visual and semantic feature alignment, aiming to generate medical reports for diseases not observed in training. It integrates a lesion-centric feature extractor and a Transformer-based report generation module. Concretely, the lesion-centric feature extractor detects the abnormal regions and learns correlations between seen and novel classes with multi-view (visual and lexical) embeddings. Then, features of the detected regions and corresponding embeddings are concatenated as multi-view input to the report generation module for explainable report generation, including text descriptions and corresponding abnormal regions detected in the images. We conduct experiments on FFA-IR, a dataset providing explainable annotations, showing that our framework outperforms others on report generation for novel diseases.","No"

General frameworks are becoming increasingly available to measure ML fairness gaps between groups. However, ML for health (ML4H) auditing principles call for a contextual, patient-centered approach to model assessment. Therefore, ML auditing tools must be (1) better aligned with ML4H auditing principles and (2) able to illuminate and characterize communities vulnerable to the most harm. To address this gap, we propose supplementing ML4H auditing frameworks with SLOGAN (patient Severity-based LOcal Group biAs detectioN), an automatic tool for capturing local biases in a clinical prediction task. SLOGAN adapts an existing tool, LOGAN (LOcal Group biAs detectioN), by contextualizing group bias detection in patient illness severity and past medical history. We investigate and compare SLOGAN's bias detection capabilities to LOGAN and other clustering techniques across patient subgroups in the MIMIC-III dataset. On average, SLOGAN identifies larger fairness disparities in over 75% of patient groups than LOGAN while maintaining clustering quality. Furthermore, in a diabetes case study, health disparity literature corroborates the characterizations of the most biased clusters identified by SLOGAN. Our results contribute to the broader discussion of how machine learning biases may perpetuate existing healthcare disparities.","No"

Recently a self-supervised speech representation based scheme, requiring no speech recognition, was proposed. This work extends the initial analysis conducted on this approach to a large scale proficiency test, Linguaskill, that comprises multiple parts, each designed to assess different attributes of a candidate's speaking proficiency. The performance of the self-supervised, wav2vec 2.0, system is compared to a high performance hand-crafted assessment system and a BERT-based text system both of which use speech transcriptions. Though the wav2vec 2.0 based system is found to be sensitive to the nature of the response, it can be configured to yield comparable performance to systems requiring a speech transcription, and yields gains when appropriately combined with standard approaches.","No"
"A generative grammar of cooking","Ganesh Bagler",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09059","Cooking is a uniquely human endeavor for transforming raw ingredients into delicious dishes. Over centuries, cultures worldwide have evolved diverse cooking practices ingrained in their culinary traditions. Recipes, thus, are cultural capsules that capture culinary knowledge in elaborate cooking protocols. While simple quantitative models have probed the patterns in recipe composition and the process of cuisine evolution, unlike other cultural quirks such as language, the principles of cooking remain hitherto unexplored. The fundamental rules that drive the act of cooking, shaping recipe composition and cuisine architecture, are unclear. Here we present a generative grammar of cooking that captures the underlying culinary logic. By studying an extensive repository of structured recipes, we identify core concepts and rules that together forge a combinatorial system for culinary synthesis. Building on the body of work done in the context of language, the demonstration of a logically consistent generative framework offers profound insights into the act of cooking. Given the central role of food in nutrition and lifestyle disorders, culinary grammar provides leverage to improve public health through dietary interventions beyond applications for creative pursuits such as novel recipe generation.","No"
"Teaching Algorithmic Reasoning via In-context Learning","Hattie Zhou, Azade Nova, Hugo Larochelle, Aaron Courville, Behnam Neyshabur, Hanie Sedghi",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09066","Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing in-context learning capabilities through scaling up model and data size. Despite this progress, LLMs are still unable to solve algorithmic reasoning problems. While providing a rationale with the final answer has led to further improvements in multi-step reasoning problems, Anil et al. 2022 showed that even simple algorithmic reasoning tasks such as parity are far from solved. In this work, we identify and study four key stages for successfully teaching algorithmic reasoning to LLMs: (1) formulating algorithms as skills, (2) teaching multiple skills simultaneously (skill accumulation), (3) teaching how to combine skills (skill composition) and (4) teaching how to use skills as tools. We show that it is possible to teach algorithmic reasoning to LLMs via in-context learning, which we refer to as algorithmic prompting. We evaluate our approach on a variety of arithmetic and quantitative reasoning tasks, and demonstrate significant boosts in performance over existing prompting techniques. In particular, for long parity, addition, multiplication and subtraction, we achieve an error reduction of approximately 10x, 9x, 5x and 2x respectively compared to the best available baselines.","No"
"Unified Question Answering in Slovene","Katja Logar, Marko Robnik-\v{S}ikonja",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09159","Question answering is one of the most challenging tasks in language understanding. Most approaches are developed for English, while less-resourced languages are much less researched. We adapt a successful English question-answering approach, called UnifiedQA, to the less-resourced Slovene language.

We use existing Slovene adaptations of four datasets, and machine translate the MCTest dataset. We show that a general model can answer questions in different formats at least as well as specialized models. The results are further improved using cross-lingual transfer from English. While we produce state-of-the-art results for Slovene, the performance still lags behind English.","No"

This survey starts by introducing ERC, elaborating on the challenges and opportunities pertaining to this task. It proceeds with a description of the main emotion taxonomies and methods to deal with subjectivity in annotations. It then describes Deep Learning methods relevant for ERC, word embeddings, and elaborates on the use of performance metrics for the task and methods to deal with the typically unbalanced ERC datasets.

"A Graph-Based Context-Aware Model to Understand Online Conversations","Vibhor Agarwal, Anthony P. Young, Sagar Joglekar, Nishanth Sastry",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09207","Online forums that allow for participatory engagement between users have been transformative for the public discussion of many important issues. However, such conversations can sometimes escalate into full-blown exchanges of hate and misinformation. Existing approaches in natural language processing (NLP), such as deep learning models for classification tasks, use as inputs only a single comment or a pair of comments depending upon whether the task concerns the inference of properties of the individual comments or the replies between pairs of comments, respectively. But in online conversations, comments and replies may be based on external context beyond the immediately relevant information that is input to the model. Therefore, being aware of the conversations' surrounding contexts should improve the model's performance for the inference task at hand. We propose GraphNLI, a novel graph-based deep learning architecture that uses graph walks to incorporate the wider context of a conversation in a principled manner. Specifically, a graph walk starts from a given comment and samples 'nearby' comments in the same or parallel conversation threads, which results in additional embeddings that are aggregated together with the initial comment's embedding. We then use these enriched embeddings for downstream NLP prediction tasks that are important for online conversations. We evaluate GraphNLI on two such tasks - polarity prediction and misogynistic hate speech detection - and found that our model consistently outperforms all relevant baselines for both tasks. Specifically, GraphNLI with a biased root-seeking random walk performs with a macro-F1 score of 3 and 6 percentage points better than the best-performing BERT-based baselines for the polarity prediction and hate speech detection tasks, respectively.","No"

Vrochidis",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09235","Existing approaches for disfluency detection typically require the existence of large annotated datasets. However, current datasets for this task are limited, suffer from class imbalance, and lack some types of disfluencies that can be encountered in real-world scenarios. This work proposes LARD, a method for automatically generating artificial disfluencies from fluent text. LARD can simulate all the different types of disfluencies (repetitions, replacements and restarts) based on the reparandum/interregnum annotation scheme. In addition, it incorporates contextual embeddings into the disfluency generation to produce realistic context-aware artificial disfluencies. Since the proposed method requires only fluent text, it can be used directly for training, bypassing the requirement of annotated disfluent data. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that LARD can indeed be effectively used when no or only a few data are available. Furthermore, our detailed analysis suggests that the proposed method generates realistic disfluencies and increases the accuracy of existing disfluency detectors.","No"

In this paper, we demonstrate that current response generation (RG) models produce generic and dull responses in dialogues because they act reflexively, failing to explicitly model CG, both due to the lack of CG in training data and the standard RG training procedure. We introduce Reflect, a dataset that annotates dialogues with explicit CG (materialized as inferences approximating shared knowledge and beliefs) and solicits 9k diverse human-generated responses each following one common ground. Using Reflect, we showcase the limitations of current dialogue data and RG models: less than half of the responses in current data are rated as high quality (sensible, specific, and interesting) and models trained using this data have even lower quality, while most Reflect responses are judged high quality. Next, we analyze whether CG can help models produce better-quality responses by using Reflect CG to guide RG models. Surprisingly, we find that simply prompting GPT3 to 'think' about CG generates 30% more quality responses, showing promising benefits to integrating CG into the RG process.","No"

"Data-Efficient Autoregressive Document Retrieval for Fact Verification","James Thorne",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09388","Document retrieval is a core component of many knowledge-intensive natural language processing task formulations such as fact verification and question answering. Sources of textual knowledge, such as Wikipedia articles, condition the generation of answers from the models. Recent advances in retrieval use sequence-to-sequence models to incrementally predict the title of the appropriate Wikipedia page given a query. However, this method requires supervision in the form of human annotation to label which Wikipedia pages contain appropriate context. This paper introduces a distant-supervision method that does not require any annotation to train autoregressive retrievers that attain competitive R-Precision and Recall in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore we show that with task-specific supervised fine-tuning, autoregressive retrieval performance for two Wikipedia-based fact verification tasks can approach or even exceed full supervision using less than $1/4$ of the annotated data indicating possible directions for data-efficient autoregressive retrieval.","No"

Existing translate-train or knowledge distillation methods attempt to bridge the language gap, but often introduce a high level of noise. To solve this problem, consistency training methods regularize the model to be robust towards perturbations on data or hidden states. However, such methods are likely to violate the consistency hypothesis, or mainly focus on coarse-grain consistency. We propose ConNER as a novel consistency training framework for cross-lingual NER, which comprises of: (1) translation-based consistency training on unlabeled target-language data, and (2) dropoutbased consistency training on labeled source-language data. ConNER effectively leverages unlabeled target-language data and alleviates overfitting on the source language to enhance the cross-lingual adaptability. Experimental results show our ConNER achieves consistent improvement over various baseline methods.","No"

"Feature-augmented Machine Reading Comprehension with Auxiliary Tasks","Yifeng Xie",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09438","While most successful approaches for machine reading comprehension rely on single training objective, it is assumed that the encoder layer can learn great representation through the loss function we define in the predict layer, which is cross entropy in most of time, in the case that we first use neural networks to encode the question and paragraph, then directly fuse the encoding result of them. However, due to the distantly loss backpropagating in reading comprehension, the encoder layer cannot learn effectively and be directly supervised. Thus, the encoder layer can not learn the representation well at any time. Base on this, we propose to inject multi granularity information to the encoding layer. Experiments demonstrate the effect of adding multi granularity information to the encoding layer can boost the performance of machine reading comprehension system.

In this paper we propose a protocol that aims to increase objectivity by grounding evaluations in Consultation Checklists, which are created in a preliminary step and then used as a common point of reference during quality assessment. We observed good levels of inter-annotator agreement in a first evaluation study using the protocol; further, using Consultation Checklists produced in the study as reference for automatic metrics such as ROUGE or BERTScore improves their correlation with human judgements compared to using the original human note.","No"
"Abstractive Summarization Guided by Latent Hierarchical Document Structure","Yifu Qiu, Shay B. Cohen",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09458","Sequential abstractive neural summarizers often do not use the underlying structure in the input article or dependencies between the input sentences. This structure is essential to integrate and consolidate information from different parts of the text. To address this shortcoming, we propose a hierarchy-aware graph neural network (HierGNN) which captures such dependencies through three main steps: 1) learning a hierarchical document structure through a latent structure tree learned by a sparse matrix-tree computation; 2) propagating sentence information over this structure using a novel message-passing node propagation mechanism to identify salient information; 3) using graph-level attention to concentrate the decoder on salient information. Experiments confirm HierGNN improves strong sequence models such as BART, with a 0.55 and 0.75 margin in average ROUGE-1/2/L for CNN/DM and XSum. Further human evaluation demonstrates that summaries produced by our model are more relevant and less redundant than the baselines, into which HierGNN is incorporated. We also find HierGNN synthesizes summaries by fusing multiple source sentences more, rather than compressing a single source sentence, and that it processes long inputs more effectively.","No"

"The Effectiveness of Bidirectional Generative Patent Language Models","Jieh-Sheng Lee",9,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09690","Generative patent language models can assist humans to write patent text more effectively. The question is how to measure effectiveness from a human-centric perspective and how to improve effectiveness. In this manuscript, a simplified design of the autocomplete function is proposed to increase effectiveness by more than 10%. With the new design, the effectiveness of autocomplete can reach more than 60%, which means that more than 60% of keystrokes can be saved by autocomplete. Since writing patent text does not necessarily start from the beginning to the end, a question is whether the generative model can assist a user no matter where to start writing. To answer the question, the generative models in this manuscript are pre-trained with training data in both directions. The generative models become bidirectional. Since text generation is bidirectional, the calculation of autocomplete effectiveness can be bidirectional and starts from anywhere in the text. After thorough experiments, a key finding is that the autocomplete effectiveness of a model for the same text remains similar no matter where the calculation starts. The finding indicates that such bidirectional models can assist a user at a similar level, no matter where the user starts to write.","No"

The generated hypothesis is then sent to downstream components for further action. However, it is desirable to discard an incorrect hypothesis before sending it downstream. In this work, we present two designs for SLU hypothesis rejection modules: (i) scheme R1 that performs rejection on domain specific SLU hypothesis and, (ii) scheme R2 that performs rejection on hypothesis generated from the overall SLU system. Hypothesis rejection modules in both schemes reject/accept a hypothesis based on features drawn from the utterance directed to the SLU system, the associated SLU hypothesis and SLU confidence score.

The parameters of a trained neural network model may affect task performance unevenly, which suggests non-equal importance among the parameters. Compared to SVD, the decomposition method aware of parameter importance is the more practical choice in real cases. Unlike standard SVD, weighted value decomposition is a non-convex optimization problem that lacks a closed-form solution. We systematically investigated multiple optimization strategies to tackle the problem and examined our method by compressing Transformer-based language models. Further, we designed a metric to predict when the SVD may introduce a significant performance drop, for which our method can be a rescue strategy. The extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method can perform better than current SOTA methods in compressing Transformer-based language models.","No"

Such trained models can achieve significantly higher performance beyond what can be done when trained on a single data source. As part of FL's promises, none of the training data is ever transmitted to any central location, ensuring that sensitive data remains local and private. These characteristics make FL perfectly suited for large-scale applications in healthcare, where a variety of compliance constraints restrict how data may be handled, processed, and stored. Despite the apparent benefits of federated learning, the heterogeneity in the local data distributions pose significant challenges, and such challenges are even more pronounced in the case of multilingual data providers.

Our work represents one of the first such production-scale systems, capable of training across multiple highly heterogeneous data providers, and achieving levels of accuracy that could not be otherwise achieved by using central training with public data.

We develop a simple, yet effective prosody-control strategy whereby additional tokens are introduced into source text during training to represent specific stuttering characteristics. By choosing the position of the stutter tokens, Stutter-TTS allows word-level control of where stuttering occurs in the synthesized utterance. We are able to synthesize stutter events with high accuracy (F1-scores between 0.63 and 0.84, depending on stutter type).

The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the current events being discussed on social media platforms. In order to safeguard societies from this pandemic, studying people's emotions on social media is crucial. As a result of their particular characteristics, sentiment analysis of texts like tweets remains challenging. Sentiment analysis is a powerful text analysis tool. It automatically detects and analyzes opinions and emotions from unstructured data. Texts from a wide range of sources are examined by a sentiment analysis tool, which extracts meaning from them, including emails, surveys, reviews, social media posts, and web articles. To evaluate sentiments, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques are used, which assign weights to entities, topics, themes, and categories in sentences or phrases. Machine learning tools learn how to detect sentiment without human intervention by examining examples of emotions in text. In a pandemic situation, analyzing social media texts to uncover sentimental trends can be very helpful in gaining a better understanding of society's needs and predicting future trends. We intend to study society's perception of the COVID-19 pandemic through social media using state-of-the-art BERT and Deep CNN models.

We extend work in syntactic probing to the incremental setting and present several probes for extracting incomplete syntactic structure (operationalized through parse states from a stack-based parser) from autoregressive language models. We find that our probes can be used to predict model preferences on ambiguous sentence prefixes and causally intervene on model representations and steer model behavior. This suggests implicit incremental syntactic inferences underlie next-word predictions in autoregressive neural language models.","No"
"Efficient Transformers with Dynamic Token Pooling","Piotr Nawrot, Jan Chorowski, Adrian {\L}a\'ncucki, Edoardo M. Ponti",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09761","Transformers achieve unrivalled performance in modelling language, but remain inefficient in terms of memory and time complexity. A possible remedy is to reduce the sequence length in the intermediate layers by pooling fixed-length segments of tokens. Nevertheless, natural units of meaning, such as words or phrases, display varying sizes. To address this mismatch, we equip language models with a dynamic-pooling mechanism, which predicts segment boundaries in an autoregressive fashion. We compare several methods to infer boundaries, including end-to-end learning through stochastic re-parameterisation, supervised learning (based on segmentations from subword tokenizers or spikes in conditional entropy), as well as linguistically motivated boundaries. We perform character-level evaluation on texts from multiple datasets and morphologically diverse languages. The results demonstrate that dynamic pooling, which jointly segments and models language, is often both faster and more accurate than vanilla Transformers and fixed-length pooling within the same computational budget.","No"

The most effective approaches for this task are based on deep learning, which generally require expensive manually labeled image-query or patch-query pairs. To eliminate the heavy dependence on human annotations, we present a novel method, named Pseudo-Q, to automatically generate pseudo language queries for supervised training. Our method leverages an off-the-shelf object detector to identify visual objects from unlabeled images, and then language queries for these objects are obtained in an unsupervised fashion with a pseudo-query generation module. Then, we design a task-related query prompt module to specifically tailor generated pseudo language queries for visual grounding tasks. Further, in order to fully capture the contextual relationships between images and language queries, we develop a visual-language model equipped with multi-level cross-modality attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method has two notable benefits: (1) it can reduce human annotation costs significantly, e.g., 31% on RefCOCO without degrading original model's performance under the fully supervised setting, and (2) without bells and whistles, it achieves superior or comparable performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised visual grounding methods on all the five datasets we have experimented.

As a component of the framework, we trained and evaluated a low-quality image detection model that simultaneously learns difficulty in recognizing images and individual flaws, and we demonstrated that our proposal can explain the reasons for flaws with a sufficient score. We also evaluated a dataset with low-quality images removed by our framework and found improved values for all four common metrics (e.g., BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr), confirming an improvement in general-purpose image captioning capability.

Smith, Jiebo Luo",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09699","Image captioning aims to describe an image with a natural language sentence, allowing powerful language models to understand images. The framework of combining image captioning with language models has been successful on various vision-language tasks. However, an image contains much more information than a single sentence, leading to underspecification of which visual entities should be described in the caption sentence. For example, when performing visual questioning answering (VQA), generic image captions often miss visual details that are essential for the language model to answer correctly. To address this challenge, we propose PromptCap, a captioning model that takes a natural-language prompt to control the contents of the generated caption. The prompt contains a question that the caption should help to answer, and also supports taking auxiliary text inputs such as scene text within the image itself. To finetune a general image caption model for prompt-guided captioning, we propose a pipeline to synthesize and filter training examples with GPT-3 and existing VQA datasets. For evaluation, we start with an existing pipeline in which a language model is prompted with image captions to carry out VQA. With the same language model, a higher QA accuracy shows that our generated captions are more relevant to the question prompts. PromptCap outperforms generic captions by a large margin on a variety of VQA tasks and achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 58.8 % on OK-VQA and 58.0 % on A-OKVQA.

In the proposed method, an encoder, learned by optimizing a representation loss and an adversarial loss, is used to extract the relation of sentences in the source and target domain. The representation loss, including a cross-entropy loss and a contrastive loss, makes the encoder extract the relation of the source domain and keep the geometric structure of the classes in the source domain.

In this report, we define the underlying tasks in terms of natural language processing, and present a dataset and measures for benchmarking them. We also present a model that implements these tasks, by combining an inclusive language database with an elaborate sequence of processing steps via standard pre-trained models. Our model achieves a recall of 0.89 and a precision of 0.82 in our benchmark for identifying exclusive language; and one of its top five suggestions is chosen in real-world texts in 44% of cases. We sketch how the area could be further advanced by training end-to-end models and using large language models; and we urge the community to include more gender-inclusive texts in their training data in order to not present an obstacle to the adoption of gender-inclusive language. Through these efforts, we hope to contribute to restoring justice in language and, to a small extent, in reality.","No"

However, current approaches to leveraging transformers to understand language expose one weak spot: Number understanding. In some scenarios, numbers frequently occur, especially in semi-structured data like tables. But current approaches to rich-number tasks with transformer-based language models abandon or lose some of the numeracy information - e.g., breaking numbers into sub-word tokens - which leads to many number-related errors. In this paper, we propose the LUNA framework which improves the numerical reasoning and calculation capabilities of transformer-based language models. With the number plugin of NumTok and NumBed, LUNA represents each number as a whole to model input. With number pre-training, including regression loss and model distillation, LUNA bridges the gap between number and vocabulary embeddings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly injects numeracy capability into language models using Number Plugins. Besides evaluating toy models on toy tasks, we evaluate LUNA on three large-scale transformer models (RoBERTa, BERT, TabBERT) over three different downstream tasks (TATQA, TabFact, CrediTrans), and observe the performances of language models are constantly improved by LUNA. The augmented models also improve the official baseline of TAT-QA (EM: 50.15 -> 59.58) and achieve SOTA performance on CrediTrans (F1 = 86.17).","No"

In particular, we will use the arXiv dataset, consisting of several scientific papers and the corresponding abstracts, as baselines for this work. Then, we propose a novel retrieval-enhanced approach based on the architecture which reduces the cost of generating a summary of the entire document by processing smaller chunks. The results were below the baselines but suggest a more efficient memory a consumption and truthfulness.","No"

However, there has been limited research on the zero-shot KBC settings, where we need to deal with unseen entities and relations that emerge in a constantly growing knowledge base. In this work, we systematically examine different possible scenarios of zero-shot KBC and develop a comprehensive benchmark, ZeroKBC, that covers these scenarios with diverse types of knowledge sources. Our systematic analysis reveals several missing yet important zero-shot KBC settings. Experimental results show that canonical and state-of-the-art KBC systems cannot achieve satisfactory performance on this challenging benchmark. By analyzing the strength and weaknesses of these systems on solving ZeroKBC, we further present several important observations and promising future directions.","No"

First, in TM retrieval phase, we adopt a contrastive retrieval algorithm to avoid redundancy and uninformativeness of similar translation pieces. Second, in memory encoding stage, given a set of TMs we propose a novel Hierarchical Group Attention module to gather both local context of each TM and global context of the whole TM set. Finally, in training phase, a Multi-TM contrastive learning objective is introduced to learn salient feature of each TM with respect to target sentence.

"LawngNLI: A Long-Premise Benchmark for In-Domain Generalization from Short to Long Contexts and for Implication-Based Retrieval","William Bruno, Dan Roth",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03222","Natural language inference has trended toward studying contexts beyond the sentence level. An important application area is law: past cases often do not foretell how they apply to new situations and implications must be inferred. This paper introduces LawngNLI, constructed from U.S. legal opinions with automatic labels with high human-validated accuracy. Premises are long and multigranular. Experiments show two use cases. First, LawngNLI can benchmark for in-domain generalization from short to long contexts. It has remained unclear if large-scale long-premise NLI datasets actually need to be constructed: near-top performance on long premises could be achievable by fine-tuning using short premises. Without multigranularity, benchmarks cannot distinguish lack of fine-tuning on long premises versus domain shift between short and long datasets. In contrast, our long and short premises share the same examples and domain. Models fine-tuned using several past NLI datasets and/or our short premises fall short of top performance on our long premises. So for at least certain domains (such as ours), large-scale long-premise datasets are needed. Second, LawngNLI can benchmark for implication-based retrieval. Queries are entailed or contradicted by target documents, allowing users to move between arguments and evidence. Leading retrieval models perform reasonably zero shot on a LawngNLI-derived retrieval task. We compare different systems for re-ranking, including lexical overlap and cross-encoders fine-tuned using a modified LawngNLI or past NLI datasets. LawngNLI can train and test systems for implication-based case retrieval and argumentation.","No"

Although existing literature highlights that the acceptance of the autonomous car will increase if it drives in a human-like manner, sparse research offers the naturalistic experience from a passenger's seat perspective to examine the human likeness of current autonomous cars. The present study tested whether the AI driver could create a human-like ride experience for passengers based on 69 participants' feedback in a real-road scenario. We designed a ride experience-based version of the non-verbal Turing test for automated driving. Participants rode in autonomous cars (driven by either human or AI drivers) as a passenger and judged whether the driver was human or AI. The AI driver failed to pass our test because passengers detected the AI driver above chance. In contrast, when the human driver drove the car, the passengers' judgement was around chance. We further investigated how human passengers ascribe humanness in our test. Based on Lewin's field theory, we advanced a computational model combining signal detection theory with pre-trained language models to predict passengers' humanness rating behaviour. We employed affective transition between pre-study baseline emotions and corresponding post-stage emotions as the signal strength of our model. Results showed that the passengers' ascription of humanness would increase with the greater affective transition. Our study suggested an important role of affective transition in passengers' ascription of humanness, which might become a future direction for autonomous driving.","No"
"CySecBERT: A Domain-Adapted Language Model for the Cybersecurity Domain","Markus Bayer, Philipp Kuehn, Ramin Shanehsaz, Christian Reuter",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02974","The field of cybersecurity is evolving fast. Experts need to be informed about past, current and - in the best case - upcoming threats, because attacks are becoming more advanced, targets bigger and systems more complex. As this cannot be addressed manually, cybersecurity experts need to rely on machine learning techniques. In the texutual domain, pre-trained language models like BERT have shown to be helpful, by providing a good baseline for further fine-tuning. However, due to the domain-knowledge and many technical terms in cybersecurity general language models might miss the gist of textual information, hence doing more harm than good. For this reason, we create a high-quality dataset and present a language model specifically tailored to the cybersecurity domain, which can serve as a basic building block for cybersecurity systems that deal with natural language. The model is compared with other models based on 15 different domain-dependent extrinsic and intrinsic tasks as well as general tasks from the SuperGLUE benchmark. On the one hand, the results of the intrinsic tasks show that our model improves the internal representation space of words compared to the other models. On the other hand, the extrinsic, domain-dependent tasks, consisting of sequence tagging and classification, show that the model is best in specific application scenarios, in contrast to the others. Furthermore, we show that our approach against catastrophic forgetting works, as the model is able to retrieve the previously trained domain-independent knowledge.

"Semantic-Conditional Diffusion Networks for Image Captioning","Jianjie Luo and Yehao Li and Yingwei Pan and Ting Yao and Jianlin Feng and Hongyang Chao and Tao Mei",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03099","Recent advances on text-to-image generation have witnessed the rise of diffusion models which act as powerful generative models. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to exploit such latent variable models to capture the dependency among discrete words and meanwhile pursue complex visual-language alignment in image captioning. In this paper, we break the deeply rooted conventions in learning Transformer-based encoder-decoder, and propose a new diffusion model based paradigm tailored for image captioning, namely Semantic-Conditional Diffusion Networks (SCD-Net). Technically, for each input image, we first search the semantically relevant sentences via cross-modal retrieval model to convey the comprehensive semantic information. The rich semantics are further regarded as semantic prior to trigger the learning of Diffusion Transformer, which produces the output sentence in a diffusion process. In SCD-Net, multiple Diffusion Transformer structures are stacked to progressively strengthen the output sentence with better visional-language alignment and linguistical coherence in a cascaded manner. Furthermore, to stabilize the diffusion process, a new self-critical sequence training strategy is designed to guide the learning of SCD-Net with the knowledge of a standard autoregressive Transformer model. Extensive experiments on COCO dataset demonstrate the promising potential of using diffusion models in the challenging image captioning task.

"Switching to Discriminative Image Captioning by Relieving a Bottleneck of Reinforcement Learning","Ukyo Honda, Taro Watanabe, Yuji Matsumoto",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03230","Discriminativeness is a desirable feature of image captions: captions should describe the characteristic details of input images. However, recent high-performing captioning models, which are trained with reinforcement learning (RL), tend to generate overly generic captions despite their high performance in various other criteria. First, we investigate the cause of the unexpectedly low discriminativeness and show that RL has a deeply rooted side effect of limiting the output words to high-frequency words. The limited vocabulary is a severe bottleneck for discriminativeness as it is difficult for a model to describe the details beyond its vocabulary. Then, based on this identification of the bottleneck, we drastically recast discriminative image captioning as a much simpler task of encouraging low-frequency word generation. Hinted by long-tail classification and debiasing methods, we propose methods that easily switch off-the-shelf RL models to discriminativeness-aware models with only a single-epoch fine-tuning on the part of the parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance the discriminativeness of off-the-shelf RL models and even outperform previous discriminativeness-aware methods with much smaller computational costs. Detailed analysis and human evaluation also verify that our methods boost the discriminativeness without sacrificing the overall quality of captions.","No"
"Bidirectional Representations for Low Resource Spoken Language Understanding","Quentin Meeus, Marie-Francine Moens, Hugo Van hamme",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14320","Most spoken language understanding systems use a pipeline approach composed of an automatic speech recognition interface and a natural language understanding module. This approach forces hard decisions when converting continuous inputs into discrete language symbols. Instead, we propose a representation model to encode speech in rich bidirectional encodings that can be used for downstream tasks such as intent prediction. The approach uses a masked language modelling objective to learn the representations, and thus benefits from both the left and right contexts. We show that the performance of the resulting encodings before fine-tuning is better than comparable models on multiple datasets, and that fine-tuning the top layers of the representation model improves the current state of the art on the Fluent Speech Command dataset, also in a low-data regime, when a limited amount of labelled data is used for training. Furthermore, we propose class attention as a spoken language understanding module, efficient both in terms of speed and number of parameters. Class attention can be used to visually explain the predictions of our model, which goes a long way in understanding how the model makes predictions.

However, gender bias, e.g., stereotypical gender roles, in this literature may cause harm and skew children's world view. Instead of decades of qualitative and manual analysis of gender bias in fairy tales, we computationally analyze gender bias in a fairy tale dataset containing 624 fairy tales from 7 different cultures. We specifically examine gender difference in terms of moral foundations, which are measures of human morality, and events, which reveal human activities associated with each character. We find that the number of male characters is two times that of female characters, showing a disproportionate gender representation. Our analysis further reveal stereotypical portrayals of both male and female characters in terms of moral foundations and events. Female characters turn out more associated with care-, loyalty- and sanctity- related moral words, while male characters are more associated with fairness- and authority- related moral words. Female characters' events are often about emotion (e.g., weep), appearance (e.g., comb), household (e.g., bake), etc.; while male characters' events are more about profession (e.g., hunt), violence (e.g., destroy), justice (e.g., judge), etc. Gender bias in terms of moral foundations shows an obvious difference across cultures. For example, female characters are more associated with care and sanctity in high uncertainty-avoidance cultures which are less open to changes and unpredictability. Based on the results, we propose implications for children's literature and early literacy research.","No"
"Finetuning BERT on Partially Annotated NER Corpora","Viktor Scherbakov and Vladimir Mayorov",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14360","Most Named Entity Recognition (NER) models operate under the assumption that training datasets are fully labelled.

This work presents an approach to finetuning BERT on such partially labelled datasets using self-supervision and label preprocessing. Our approach outperforms the previous LSTM-based label preprocessing baseline, significantly improving the performance on poorly labelled datasets. We demonstrate that following our approach while finetuning RoBERTa on CoNLL 2003 dataset with only 10% of total entities labelled is enough to reach the performance of the baseline trained on the same dataset with 50% of the entities labelled.","No"

In this paper, we investigate the bias present in monolingual BERT models across a diverse set of languages (English, Greek, and Persian). While recent research has mostly focused on gender-related biases, we analyze religious and ethnic biases as well and propose a template-based method to measure any kind of bias, based on sentence pseudo-likelihood, that can handle morphologically complex languages with gender-based adjective declensions. We analyze each monolingual model via this method and visualize cultural similarities and differences across different dimensions of bias. Ultimately, we conclude that current methods of probing for bias are highly language-dependent, necessitating cultural insights regarding the unique ways bias is expressed in each language and culture (e.g. through coded language, synecdoche, and other similar linguistic concepts). We also hypothesize that higher measured social biases in the non-English BERT models correlate with user-generated content in their training.","No"

In each iteration, SKD samples a teacher model from a pre-defined teacher ensemble, which consists of multiple teacher models with multi-level capacities, to transfer knowledge into student model in an one-to-one manner. Sampling distribution plays an important role in SKD. We heuristically present three types of sampling distributions to assign appropriate probabilities for multi-level teacher models. SKD has two advantages: 1) it can preserve the diversities of multi-level teacher models via stochastically sampling single teacher model in each iteration, and 2) it can also improve the efficacy of knowledge distillation via multi-level teacher models when large capacity gap exists between the teacher model and the student model. Experimental results on GLUE benchmark show that SKDBERT reduces the size of a BERT$_{\rm BASE}$ model by 40% while retaining 99.5% performances of language understanding and being 100% faster.","No"

Existing methods usually directly predict the relations of all entity pairs of input document in a one-pass manner, ignoring the fact that predictions of some entity pairs heavily depend on the predicted results of other pairs. To deal with this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel document-level RE model with iterative inference. Our model is mainly composed of two modules: 1) a base module expected to provide preliminary relation predictions on entity pairs; 2) an inference module introduced to refine these preliminary predictions by iteratively dealing with difficultly-predicted entity pairs depending on other pairs in an easy-to-hard manner. Unlike previous methods which only consider feature information of entity pairs, our inference module is equipped with two Extended Cross Attention units, allowing it to exploit both feature information and previous predictions of entity pairs during relational inference. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage strategy to train our model. At the first stage, we only train our base module. During the second stage, we train the whole model, where contrastive learning is introduced to enhance the training of inference module. Experimental results on three commonly-used datasets show that our model consistently outperforms other competitive baselines.","No"

We tackle this task from a new perspective and propose a novel method named PCRED for ZeroRTE with Potential Candidate Relation selection and Entity boundary Detection. The model adopts a relation-first paradigm, which firstly recognizes unseen relations through candidate relation selection. By this approach, the semantics of relations are naturally infused in the context. Entities are extracted based on the context and the semantics of relations subsequently.

To mitigate this issue, we first propose a novel span-splitting representation for span-based parser that outperforms existing methods. Then we present a novel lexicon-injected semantic parser, which collects slot labels of tree representation as a lexicon, and injects lexical features to the span representation of parser. An additional slot disambiguation technique is involved to remove inappropriate span match occurrences from the lexicon. Our best parser produces a new state-of-the-art result (87.62%) on the TOP dataset, and demonstrates its adaptability to frequently updated slot lexicon entries in real task-oriented dialog, with no need of retraining.","No"
"An Automatic SOAP Classification System Using Weakly Supervision And Transfer Learning","Sunjae Kwon, Zhichao Yang, Hong Yu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14539","In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive framework for developing a machine learning-based SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) classification system without manually SOAP annotated training data or with less manually SOAP annotated training data. The system is composed of the following two parts: 1) Data construction, 2) A neural network-based SOAP classifier, and 3) Transfer learning framework. In data construction, since a manual construction of a large size training dataset is expensive, we propose a rule-based weak labeling method utilizing the structured information of an EHR note. Then, we present a SOAP classifier composed of a pre-trained language model and bi-directional long-short term memory with conditional random field (Bi-LSTM-CRF). Finally, we propose a transfer learning framework that re-uses the trained parameters of the SOAP classifier trained with the weakly labeled dataset for datasets collected from another hospital. The proposed weakly label-based learning model successfully performed SOAP classification (89.99 F1-score) on the notes collected from the target hospital. Otherwise, in the notes collected from other hospitals and departments, the performance dramatically decreased. Meanwhile, we verified that the transfer learning framework is advantageous for inter-hospital adaptation of the model increasing the models' performance in every cases. In particular, the transfer learning approach was more efficient when the manually annotated data size was smaller. We showed that SOAP classification models trained with our weakly labeling algorithm can perform SOAP classification without manually annotated data on the EHR notes from the same hospital. The transfer learning framework helps SOAP classification model's inter-hospital migration with a minimal size of the manually annotated dataset.","No"

Results show that our approach better controls lexical complexity and generates higher quality sentences than baseline methods.","No"

In this setting, the distance between two syntactically linked words can be defined as the difference between their positions. Here we want to contribute to the characterization of the actual distribution of syntactic dependency distances, and unveil its relationship with short-term memory limitations. We propose a new double-exponential model in which decay in probability is allowed to change after a break-point. This transition could mirror the transition from the processing of words chunks to higher-level structures. We find that a two-regime model -- where the first regime follows either an exponential or a power-law decay -- is the most likely one in all 20 languages we considered, independently of sentence length and annotation style. Moreover, the break-point is fairly stable across languages and averages values of 4-5 words, suggesting that the amount of words that can be simultaneously processed abstracts from the specific language to a high degree. Finally, we give an account of the relation between the best estimated model and the closeness of syntactic dependencies, as measured by a recently introduced optimality score.","No"

Since it learns joint probability of latent features of words, it has the advantage that we can train it without any prior knowledge about the goal task we want to solve. We aim to evaluate the universal applicability property of feature vectors, which has been already proven to hold for many standard NLP tasks like part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing. In our case, we want to understand the topical focus of text documents and design an efficient representation suitable for discriminating different topics. The discriminativeness can be evaluated adequately on text categorisation task. We propose a novel method to extract discriminative keywords from documents. We utilise word feature vectors to understand the relations between words better and also understand the latent topics which are discussed in the text and not mentioned directly but inferred logically. We also present a simple way to calculate document feature vectors out of extracted discriminative words. We evaluate our method on the four most popular datasets for text categorisation. We show how different discriminative metrics influence the overall results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving state-of-the-art results on text categorisation task using just a small number of extracted keywords. We prove that word feature vectors can substantially improve the topical inference of documents' meaning. We conclude that distributed representation of words can be used to build higher levels of abstraction as we demonstrate and build feature vectors of documents.","No"

Our architecture leverages a multimodal dynamic fusion network that adds minimal parameters over an existing text encoder commonly used in prior art to leverage the prosodic and acoustic cues hidden in speech. Through experiments, we show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on the widely used English Switchboard for disfluency detection and outperforms prior unimodal and multimodal systems in literature by a significant margin. In addition, we make a thorough qualitative analysis and show that, unlike text-only systems, which suffer from spurious correlations in the data, our system overcomes this problem through additional cues from speech signals. We make all our codes publicly available on GitHub.","No"
"BadPrompt: Backdoor Attacks on Continuous Prompts","Xiangrui Cai, Haidong Xu, Sihan Xu, Ying Zhang, Xiaojie Yuan",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14719","The prompt-based learning paradigm has gained much research attention recently. It has achieved state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, especially in the few-shot scenarios. While steering the downstream tasks, few works have been reported to investigate the security problems of the prompt-based models. In this paper, we conduct the first study on the vulnerability of the continuous prompt learning algorithm to backdoor attacks. We observe that the few-shot scenarios have posed a great challenge to backdoor attacks on the prompt-based models, limiting the usability of existing NLP backdoor methods. To address this challenge, we propose BadPrompt, a lightweight and task-adaptive algorithm, to backdoor attack continuous prompts. Specially, BadPrompt first generates candidate triggers which are indicative for predicting the targeted label and dissimilar to the samples of the non-targeted labels. Then, it automatically selects the most effective and invisible trigger for each sample with an adaptive trigger optimization algorithm. We evaluate the performance of BadPrompt on five datasets and two continuous prompt models. The results exhibit the abilities of BadPrompt to effectively attack continuous prompts while maintaining high performance on the clean test sets, outperforming the baseline models by a large margin. The source code of BadPrompt is publicly available at https://github.com/papersPapers/BadPrompt.","No"

"AWTE-BERT:Attending to Wordpiece Tokenization Explicitly on BERT for Joint Intent Classification and SlotFilling","Yu Guo, Zhilong Xie, Xingyan Chen, Leilei Wang and Gang Wu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14829","Intent classification and slot filling are two core tasks in natural language understanding (NLU). The interaction nature of the two tasks makes the joint models often outperform the single designs. One of the promising solutions, called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), achieves the joint optimization of the two tasks. BERT adopts the wordpiece to tokenize each input token into multiple sub-tokens, which causes a mismatch between the tokens and the labels lengths. Previous methods utilize the hidden states corresponding to the first sub-token as input to the classifier, which limits performance improvement since some hidden semantic informations is discarded in the fine-tune process. To address this issue, we propose a novel joint model based on BERT, which explicitly models the multiple sub-tokens features after wordpiece tokenization, thereby generating the context features that contribute to slot filling. Specifically, we encode the hidden states corresponding to multiple sub-tokens into a context vector via the attention mechanism. Then, we feed each context vector into the slot filling encoder, which preserves the integrity of the sentence. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves significant improvement on intent classification accuracy, slot filling F1, and sentence-level semantic frame accuracy on two public benchmark datasets. The F1 score of the slot filling in particular has been improved from 96.1 to 98.2 (2.1% absolute) on the ATIS dataset.","No"
"PUnifiedNER: a Prompting-based Unified NER System for Diverse Datasets","Jinghui Lu, Rui Zhao, Brian Mac Namee, Fei Tan",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14838","Much of named entity recognition (NER) research focuses on developing dataset-specific models based on data from the domain of interest, and a limited set of related entity types.

In this work, we present a ``versatile'' model -- the Prompting-based Unified NER system (PUnifiedNER) -- that works with data from different domains and can recognise up to 37 entity types simultaneously, and theoretically it could be as many as possible. By using prompt learning, PUnifiedNER is a novel approach that is able to jointly train across multiple corpora, implementing intelligent on-demand entity recognition. Experimental results show that PUnifiedNER leads to significant prediction benefits compared to dataset-specific models with impressively reduced model deployment costs. Furthermore, the performance of PUnifiedNER can achieve competitive or even better performance than state-of-the-art domain-specific methods for some datasets. We also perform comprehensive pilot and ablation studies to support in-depth analysis of each component in PUnifiedNER.","No"

"Improving Low-Resource Question Answering using Active Learning in Multiple Stages","Maximilian Schmidt, Andrea Bartezzaghi, Jasmina Bogojeska, A. Cristiano I. Malossi, Thang Vu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14880","Neural approaches have become very popular in the domain of Question Answering, however they require a large amount of annotated data. Furthermore, they often yield very good performance but only in the domain they were trained on. In this work we propose a novel approach that combines data augmentation via question-answer generation with Active Learning to improve performance in low resource settings, where the target domains are diverse in terms of difficulty and similarity to the source domain. We also investigate Active Learning for question answering in different stages, overall reducing the annotation effort of humans. For this purpose, we consider target domains in realistic settings, with an extremely low amount of annotated samples but with many unlabeled documents, which we assume can be obtained with little effort. Additionally, we assume sufficient amount of labeled data from the source domain is available. We perform extensive experiments to find the best setup for incorporating domain experts. Our findings show that our novel approach, where humans are incorporated as early as possible in the process, boosts performance in the low-resource, domain-specific setting, allowing for low-labeling-effort question answering systems in new, specialized domains. They further demonstrate how human annotation affects the performance of QA depending on the stage it is performed.","No"
"EPIK: Eliminating multi-model Pipelines with Knowledge-distillation","Bhavesh Laddagiri, Yash Raj, Anshuman Dash",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14920","Real-world tasks are largely composed of multiple models, each performing a sub-task in a larger chain of tasks, i.e., using the output from a model as input for another model in a multi-model pipeline. A model like MATRa performs the task of Crosslingual Transliteration in two stages, using English as an intermediate transliteration target when transliterating between two indic languages. We propose a novel distillation technique, EPIK, that condenses two-stage pipelines for hierarchical tasks into a single end-to-end model without compromising performance. This method can create end-to-end models for tasks without needing a dedicated end-to-end dataset, solving the data scarcity problem. The EPIK model has been distilled from the MATra model using this technique of knowledge distillation. The MATra model can perform crosslingual transliteration between 5 languages - English, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada and Bengali. The EPIK model executes the task of transliteration without any intermediate English output while retaining the performance and accuracy of the MATra model. The EPIK model can perform transliteration with an average CER score of 0.015 and average phonetic accuracy of 92.1%. In addition, the average time for execution has reduced by 54.3% as compared to the teacher model and has a similarity score of 97.5% with the teacher encoder. In a few cases, the EPIK model (student model) can outperform the MATra model (teacher model) even though it has been distilled from the MATra model.","No"
"Unsupervised Opinion Summarisation in the Wasserstein Space","Jiayu Song, Iman Munire Bilal, Adam Tsakalidis, Rob Procter, Maria Liakata",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14923","Opinion summarisation synthesises opinions expressed in a group of documents discussing the same topic to produce a single summary. Recent work has looked at opinion summarisation of clusters of social media posts. Such posts are noisy and have unpredictable structure, posing additional challenges for the construction of the summary distribution and the preservation of meaning compared to online reviews, which has been so far the focus of opinion summarisation. To address these challenges we present \textit{WassOS}, an unsupervised abstractive summarization model which makes use of the Wasserstein distance. A Variational Autoencoder is used to get the distribution of documents/posts, and the distributions are disentangled into separate semantic and syntactic spaces. The summary distribution is obtained using the Wasserstein barycenter of the semantic and syntactic distributions. A latent variable sampled from the summary distribution is fed into a GRU decoder with a transformer layer to produce the final summary. Our experiments on multiple datasets including Twitter clusters, Reddit threads, and reviews show that WassOS almost always outperforms the state-of-the-art on ROUGE metrics and consistently produces the best summaries with respect to meaning preservation according to human evaluations.","No"

(b) Training from scratch with only a relatively small-sized dataset of the target unstructured domain improves the segmentation results by a significant margin.","No"
"Arguments to Key Points Mapping with Prompt-based Learning","Ahnaf Mozib Samin, Behrooz Nikandish, Jingyan Chen",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14995","Handling and digesting a huge amount of information in an efficient manner has been a long-term demand in modern society. Some solutions to map key points (short textual summaries capturing essential information and filtering redundancies) to a large number of arguments/opinions have been provided recently (Bar-Haim et al., 2020). To complement the full picture of the argument-to-keypoint mapping task, we mainly propose two approaches in this paper. The first approach is to incorporate prompt engineering for fine-tuning the pre-trained language models (PLMs). The second approach utilizes prompt-based learning in PLMs to generate intermediary texts, which are then combined with the original argument-keypoint pairs and fed as inputs to a classifier, thereby mapping them. Furthermore, we extend the experiments to cross/in-domain to conduct an in-depth analysis. In our evaluation, we find that i) using prompt engineering in a more direct way (Approach 1) can yield promising results and improve the performance; ii) Approach 2 performs considerably worse than Approach 1 due to the negation issue of the PLM.","No"
"STAGE: Span Tagging and Greedy Inference Scheme for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction","Shuo Liang, Wei Wei, Xian-Ling Mao, Yuanyuan Fu, Rui Fang, Dangyang Chen",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15003","Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) has become an emerging task in sentiment analysis research, aiming to extract triplets of the aspect term, its corresponding opinion term, and its associated sentiment polarity from a given sentence. Recently, many neural networks based models with different tagging schemes have been proposed, but almost all of them have their limitations: heavily relying on 1) prior assumption that each word is only associated with a single role (e.g., aspect term, or opinion term, etc. ) and 2) word-level interactions and treating each opinion/aspect as a set of independent words. Hence, they perform poorly on the complex ASTE task, such as a word associated with multiple roles or an aspect/opinion term with multiple words. Hence, we propose a novel approach, Span TAgging and Greedy infErence (STAGE), to extract sentiment triplets in span-level, where each span may consist of multiple words and play different roles simultaneously. To this end, this paper formulates the ASTE task as a multi-class span classification problem. Specifically, STAGE generates more accurate aspect sentiment triplet extractions via exploring span-level information and constraints, which consists of two components, namely, span tagging scheme and greedy inference strategy. The former tag all possible candidate spans based on a newly-defined tagging set. The latter retrieves the aspect/opinion term with the maximum length from the candidate sentiment snippet to output sentiment triplets. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective model based on the STAGE, which outperforms the state-of-the-arts by a large margin on four widely-used datasets. Moreover, our STAGE can be easily generalized to other pair/triplet extraction tasks, which also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed scheme STAGE.","No"

"Joint Multimodal Entity-Relation Extraction Based on Edge-enhanced Graph Alignment Network and Word-pair Relation Tagging","Li Yuan, Yi Cai, Jin Wang, Qing Li",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15028","Multimodal named entity recognition (MNER) and multimodal relation extraction (MRE) are two fundamental subtasks in the multimodal knowledge graph construction task. However, the existing methods usually handle two tasks independently, which ignores the bidirectional interaction between them. This paper is the first to propose jointly performing MNER and MRE as a joint multimodal entity-relation extraction task (JMERE). Besides, the current MNER and MRE models only consider aligning the visual objects with textual entities in visual and textual graphs but ignore the entity-entity relationships and object-object relationships. To address the above challenges, we propose an edge-enhanced graph alignment network and a word-pair relation tagging (EEGA) for JMERE task. Specifically, we first design a word-pair relation tagging to exploit the bidirectional interaction between MNER and MRE and avoid the error propagation. Then, we propose an edge-enhanced graph alignment network to enhance the JMERE task by aligning nodes and edges in the cross-graph. Compared with previous methods, the proposed method can leverage the edge information to auxiliary alignment between objects and entities and find the correlations between entity-entity relationships and object-object relationships. Experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of our model.","No"

Diffusion models and many pre-trained language models have a shared training objective, i.e., denoising, making it possible to combine the two powerful models and enjoy the best of both worlds. On the one hand, diffusion models offer a promising training strategy that helps improve the generation quality. On the other hand, pre-trained denoising language models (e.g., BERT) can be used as a good initialization that accelerates convergence. We explore training BERT to learn the reverse process of a discrete diffusion process with an absorbing state and elucidate several designs to improve it. First, we propose a new noise schedule for the forward diffusion process that controls the degree of noise added at each step based on the information of each token. Second, we investigate several designs of incorporating the time step into BERT. Experiments on unconditional text generation demonstrate that DiffusionBERT achieves significant improvement over existing diffusion models for text (e.g., D3PM and Diffusion-LM) and previous generative masked language models in terms of perplexity and BLEU score.","No"

In this work, we bridge this practical gap by proposing a song rewriting system which rewrites the lyrics of an existing song such that the generated lyrics are compatible with the rhythm of the existing melody and thus singable. In particular, we propose SongRewriter, a controllable Chinese lyric generation and editing system which assists users without prior knowledge of melody composition. The system is trained by a randomized multi-level masking strategy which produces a unified model for generating entirely new lyrics or editing a few fragments. To improve the controllabiliy of the generation process, we further incorporate a keyword prompt to control the lexical choices of the content and propose novel decoding constraints and a vowel modeling task to enable flexible end and internal rhyme schemes. While prior rhyming metrics are mainly for rap lyrics, we propose three novel rhyming evaluation metrics for song lyrics. Both automatic and human evaluations show that the proposed model performs better than the state-of-the-art models in both contents and rhyming quality.

"Generalized Category Discovery with Decoupled Prototypical Network","Wenbin An, Feng Tian, Qinghua Zheng, Wei Ding, QianYing Wang, Ping Chen",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15115","Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize both known and novel categories from a set of unlabeled data, based on another dataset labeled with only known categories. Without considering differences between known and novel categories, current methods learn about them in a coupled manner, which can hurt model's generalization and discriminative ability. Furthermore, the coupled training approach prevents these models transferring category-specific knowledge explicitly from labeled data to unlabeled data, which can lose high-level semantic information and impair model performance. To mitigate above limitations, we present a novel model called Decoupled Prototypical Network (DPN). By formulating a bipartite matching problem for category prototypes, DPN can not only decouple known and novel categories to achieve different training targets effectively, but also align known categories in labeled and unlabeled data to transfer category-specific knowledge explicitly and capture high-level semantics. Furthermore, DPN can learn more discriminative features for both known and novel categories through our proposed Semantic-aware Prototypical Learning (SPL). Besides capturing meaningful semantic information, SPL can also alleviate the noise of hard pseudo labels through semantic-weighted soft assignment. Extensive experiments show that DPN outperforms state-of-the-art models by a large margin on all evaluation metrics across multiple benchmark datasets.

For designing adequate proactive dialog strategies, we propose a novel approach including both social as well as task-relevant features in the dialog. Here, the primary goal is to optimize proactive behavior so that it is task-oriented - this implies high task success and efficiency - while also being socially effective by fostering user trust.

However, existing code-to-text generation models often produce only high-level summaries of code that do not capture implementation-level choices essential for these scenarios. To fill in this gap, we propose the code explanation generation task. We first conducted a human study to identify the criteria for high-quality explanatory docstring for code. Based on that, we collected and refined a large-scale code docstring corpus and formulated automatic evaluation metrics that best match human assessments. Finally, we present a multi-stage fine-tuning strategy and baseline models for the task. Our experiments show that (1) our refined training dataset lets models achieve better performance in the explanation generation tasks compared to larger unrefined data (15x larger), and (2) fine-tuned models can generate well-structured long docstrings comparable to human-written ones. We envision our training dataset, human-evaluation protocol, recommended metrics, and fine-tuning strategy can boost future code explanation research.

"Fine-tuned Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine-Related Social Media Data: Comparative Study","Chad A Melton, Brianna M White, Robert L Davis, Robert A Bednarczyk, Arash Shaban-Nejad",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15407","This study investigated and compared public sentiment related to COVID-19 vaccines expressed on two popular social media platforms, Reddit and Twitter, harvested from January 1, 2020, to March 1, 2022. To accomplish this task, we created a fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa model to predict sentiments of approximately 9.5 million Tweets and 70 thousand Reddit comments. To fine-tune our model, our team manually labeled the sentiment of 3600 Tweets and then augmented our dataset by the method of back-translation. Text sentiment for each social media platform was then classified with our fine-tuned model using Python and the Huggingface sentiment analysis pipeline. Our results determined that the average sentiment expressed on Twitter was more negative (52% positive) than positive and the sentiment expressed on Reddit was more positive than negative (53% positive). Though average sentiment was found to vary between these social media platforms, both displayed similar behavior related to sentiment shared at key vaccine-related developments during the pandemic. Considering this similar trend in shared sentiment demonstrated across social media platforms, Twitter and Reddit continue to be valuable data sources that public health officials can utilize to strengthen vaccine confidence and combat misinformation. As the spread of misinformation poses a range of psychological and psychosocial risks (anxiety, fear, etc.), there is an urgency in understanding the public perspective and attitude toward shared falsities. Comprehensive educational delivery systems tailored to the population's expressed sentiments that facilitate digital literacy, health information-seeking behavior, and precision health promotion could aid in clarifying such misinformation.","No"
"A Benchmark for Structured Extractions from Complex Documents","Zilong Wang, Yichao Zhou, Wei Wei, Chen-Yu Lee, Sandeep Tata",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15421","Understanding visually-rich business documents to extract structured data and automate business workflows has been receiving attention both in academia and industry. Although recent multi-modal language models have achieved impressive results, we find that existing benchmarks do not reflect the complexity of real documents seen in industry. In this work, we identify the desiderata for a more comprehensive benchmark and propose one we call Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU). VRDU contains two datasets that represent several challenges: rich schema including diverse data types as well as nested entities, complex templates including tables and multi-column layouts, and diversity of different layouts (templates) within a single document type. We design few-shot and conventional experiment settings along with a carefully designed matching algorithm to evaluate extraction results. We report the performance of strong baselines and three observations: (1) generalizing to new document templates is very challenging, (2) few-shot performance has a lot of headroom, and (3) models struggle with nested fields such as line-items in an invoice. We plan to open source the benchmark and the evaluation toolkit. We hope this helps the community make progress on these challenging tasks in extracting structured data from visually rich documents.","No"

Strohman",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15432","We explore unifying a neural segmenter with two-pass cascaded encoder ASR into a single model. A key challenge is allowing the segmenter (which runs in real-time, synchronously with the decoder) to finalize the 2nd pass (which runs 900 ms behind real-time) without introducing user-perceived latency or deletion errors during inference. We propose a design where the neural segmenter is integrated with the causal 1st pass decoder to emit a end-of-segment (EOS) signal in real-time. The EOS signal is then used to finalize the non-causal 2nd pass. We experiment with different ways to finalize the 2nd pass, and find that a novel dummy frame injection strategy allows for simultaneous high quality 2nd pass results and low finalization latency. On a real-world long-form captioning task (YouTube), we achieve 2.4% relative WER and 140 ms EOS latency gains over a baseline VAD-based segmenter with the same cascaded encoder.","No"

In such classes, the element of interaction with teachers and fellow peers helps in removing learning silos and gives each student a chance to experience some aspects relevant to offline learning in this era of virtual classes. One common way of interaction in a class is through the chats / messaging framework, where the teacher can broadcast messages as well as get instant feedback from the students in the live class. This freedom of interaction is a crucial aspect for any student's learning growth but misuse of it can have serious repercussions. Some miscreants use this framework to send profane messages which can have a negative impact on other students as well as the teacher of the class. These rare but high impact situations obviate the need for automatic detection mechanisms that prevent the posting of such chats on any platform. In this work we develop YZR-Net which is a self-supervised framework that is able to robustly detect profane words used in a chat even if the student tries to add clever modifications to fool the system. The matching mechanism on token / word level allows us to maintain a compact as well as dynamic profane vocabulary which can be updated without retraining the underlying model. Our profanity detection framework is language independent and can handle abuses in both English as well as its transliterated counterpart Hinglish (Hindi language words written in English).","No"

"Mutual Exclusivity Training and Primitive Augmentation to Induce Compositionality","Yichen Jiang, Xiang Zhou, Mohit Bansal",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15578","Recent datasets expose the lack of the systematic generalization ability in standard sequence-to-sequence models. In this work, we analyze this behavior of seq2seq models and identify two contributing factors: a lack of mutual exclusivity bias (i.e., a source sequence already mapped to a target sequence is less likely to be mapped to other target sequences), and the tendency to memorize whole examples rather than separating structures from contents. We propose two techniques to address these two issues respectively: Mutual Exclusivity Training that prevents the model from producing seen generations when facing novel, unseen examples via an unlikelihood-based loss; and prim2primX data augmentation that automatically diversifies the arguments of every syntactic function to prevent memorizing and provide a compositional inductive bias without exposing test-set data. Combining these two techniques, we show substantial empirical improvements using standard sequence-to-sequence models (LSTMs and Transformers) on two widely-used compositionality datasets: SCAN and COGS. Finally, we provide analysis characterizing the improvements as well as the remaining challenges, and provide detailed ablations of our method.

"On the Effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning","Zihao Fu, Haoran Yang, Anthony Man-Cho So, Wai Lam, Lidong Bing, Nigel Collier",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15583","Fine-tuning pre-trained models has been ubiquitously proven to be effective in a wide range of NLP tasks. However, fine-tuning the whole model is parameter inefficient as it always yields an entirely new model for each task. Currently, many research works propose to only fine-tune a small portion of the parameters while keeping most of the parameters shared across different tasks. These methods achieve surprisingly good performance and are shown to be more stable than their corresponding fully fine-tuned counterparts. However, such kind of methods is still not well understood. Some natural questions arise: How does the parameter sparsity lead to promising performance? Why is the model more stable than the fully fine-tuned models? How to choose the tunable parameters? In this paper, we first categorize the existing methods into random approaches, rule-based approaches, and projection-based approaches based on how they choose which parameters to tune. Then, we show that all of the methods are actually sparse fine-tuned models and conduct a novel theoretical analysis of them. We indicate that the sparsity is actually imposing a regularization on the original model by controlling the upper bound of the stability. Such stability leads to better generalization capability which has been empirically observed in a lot of recent research works. Despite the effectiveness of sparsity grounded by our theory, it still remains an open problem of how to choose the tunable parameters. To better choose the tunable parameters, we propose a novel Second-order Approximation Method (SAM) which approximates the original problem with an analytically solvable optimization function. The tunable parameters are determined by directly optimizing the approximation function. The experimental results show that our proposed SAM model outperforms many strong baseline models and it also verifies our theoretical analysis.","No"

We assess the model performance on six commonsense reasoning benchmark tasks and report the accuracy scores for these tasks. When fine-tuned using the right set of hyperparameters, we obtain competitive scores on three of these tasks but struggle when the dataset size is significantly smaller. The low model performance on a few of these tasks suggests the inherent difficulty in these datasets and since it fails to establish coherent patterns given their limited training samples. We also investigate and substantiate our results using visualization and conduct numerous inference tests to understand the model performance better. Finally, we conduct thorough robustness tests using various methods to gauge the model performance under numerous settings.

"Frustratingly Easy Label Projection for Cross-lingual Transfer","Yang Chen, Chao Jiang, Alan Ritter, Wei Xu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15613","Translating training data into many languages has emerged as a practical solution for improving cross-lingual transfer. For tasks that involve span-level annotations, such as information extraction or question answering, an additional label projection step is required to map annotated spans onto the translated texts. Recently, a few efforts have utilized a simple mark-then-translate method to jointly perform translation and projection by inserting special markers around the labeled spans in the original sentence. However, as far as we are aware, no empirical analysis has been conducted on how this approach compares to traditional annotation projection based on word alignment. In this paper, we present an extensive empirical study across 42 languages and three tasks (QA, NER, and Event Extraction) to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of both methods, filling an important gap in the literature. Experimental results show that our optimized version of mark-then-translate, which we call EasyProject, is easily applied to many languages and works surprisingly well, outperforming the more complex word alignment-based methods. We analyze several key factors that affect end-task performance, and show EasyProject works well because it can accurately preserve label span boundaries after translation.

We manually annotate how they are created, including input text and label sources and tools used to build them, and what they study, tasks they address and motivations for their creation. After quantifying the qualitative NLP resource gap across languages, we discuss how to improve data collection in low-resource languages. We survey language-proficient NLP researchers and crowd workers per language, finding that their estimated availability correlates with dataset availability.

In this paper, we introduce a new task setting, Contextual TTS (CTTS). The main idea of CTTS is that how a person speaks depends on the particular context she is in, where the context can typically be represented as text. Thus, in the CTTS task, we propose to utilize such context to guide the speech synthesis process instead of relying on explicit labels of styles and emotions. To achieve this task, we construct a synthetic dataset and develop an effective framework. Experiments show that our framework can generate high-quality expressive speech based on the given context both in synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios.","No"

However, since the local data is inaccessible to the server under federated learning, attackers may easily poison the training data of the local client to build a backdoor in the agent without notice. Deploying such an agent raises the risk of potential harm to humans, as the attackers may easily navigate and control the agent as they wish via the backdoor. Towards Byzantine-robust federated embodied agent learning, in this paper, we study the attack and defense for the task of vision-and-language navigation (VLN), where the agent is required to follow natural language instructions to navigate indoor environments. First, we introduce a simple but effective attack strategy, Navigation as Wish (NAW), in which the malicious client manipulates local trajectory data to implant a backdoor into the global model. Results on two VLN datasets (R2R and RxR) show that NAW can easily navigate the deployed VLN agent regardless of the language instruction, without affecting its performance on normal test sets. Then, we propose a new Prompt-Based Aggregation (PBA) to defend against the NAW attack in federated VLN, which provides the server with a ''prompt'' of the vision-and-language alignment variance between the benign and malicious clients so that they can be distinguished during training. We validate the effectiveness of the PBA method on protecting the global model from the NAW attack, which outperforms other state-of-the-art defense methods by a large margin in the defense metrics on R2R and RxR.","No"
"Alignment-Enriched Tuning for Patch-Level Pre-trained Document Image Models","Lei Wang, Jiabang He, Xing Xu, Ning Liu, Hui Liu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14777","Alignment between image and text has shown promising improvements on patch-level pre-trained document image models. However, investigating more effective or finer-grained alignment techniques during pre-training requires a large amount of computation cost and time. Thus, a question naturally arises: Could we fine-tune the pre-trained models adaptive to downstream tasks with alignment objectives and achieve comparable or better performance? In this paper, we propose a new model architecture with alignment-enriched tuning (dubbed AETNet) upon pre-trained document image models, to adapt downstream tasks with the joint task-specific supervised and alignment-aware contrastive objective. Specifically, we introduce an extra visual transformer as the alignment-ware image encoder and an extra text transformer as the alignment-ware text encoder before multimodal fusion. We consider alignment in the following three aspects: 1) document-level alignment by leveraging the cross-modal and intra-modal contrastive loss; 2) global-local alignment for modeling localized and structural information in document images; and 3) local-level alignment for more accurate patch-level information. Experiments on various downstream tasks show that AETNet can achieve state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks. Notably, AETNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pre-trained models, such as LayoutLMv3 with fine-tuning techniques, on three different downstream tasks.","No"

Specifically, we propose three objectives to adapt the generic CodeT5 for debugging: a bug detection objective to determine whether a given code snippet is buggy or not, a bug localization objective to identify the buggy lines, and a program repair objective to translate the buggy code to its fixed version. We evaluate it on each of these tasks and their combined setting on two newly collected line-level debugging datasets in Java and Python. Extensive results show that our model significantly outperforms existing baselines from both NLP and software engineering domains.","No"
"Multi-Modal Few-Shot Temporal Action Detection via Vision-Language Meta-Adaptation","Sauradip Nag, Mengmeng Xu, Xiatian Zhu, Juan-Manuel Perez-Rua, Bernard Ghanem, Yi-Zhe Song and Tao Xiang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14905","Few-shot (FS) and zero-shot (ZS) learning are two different approaches for scaling temporal action detection (TAD) to new classes. The former adapts a pretrained vision model to a new task represented by as few as a single video per class, whilst the latter requires no training examples by exploiting a semantic description of the new class. In this work, we introduce a new multi-modality few-shot (MMFS) TAD problem, which can be considered as a marriage of FS-TAD and ZS-TAD by leveraging few-shot support videos and new class names jointly. To tackle this problem, we further introduce a novel MUlti-modality PromPt mETa-learning (MUPPET) method. This is enabled by efficiently bridging pretrained vision and language models whilst maximally reusing already learned capacity. Concretely, we construct multi-modal prompts by mapping support videos into the textual token space of a vision-language model using a meta-learned adapter-equipped visual semantics tokenizer. To tackle large intra-class variation, we further design a query feature regulation scheme. Extensive experiments on ActivityNetv1.3 and THUMOS14 demonstrate that our MUPPET outperforms state-of-the-art alternative methods, often by a large margin. We also show that our MUPPET can be easily extended to tackle the few-shot object detection problem and again achieves the state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO dataset.

Botvinick and Christopher Summerfield",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15006","Recent work in large language modeling (LLMs) has used fine-tuning to align outputs with the preferences of a prototypical user. This work assumes that human preferences are static and homogeneous across individuals, so that aligning to a a single 'generic' user will confer more general alignment. Here, we embrace the heterogeneity of human preferences to consider a different challenge: how might a machine help people with diverse views find agreement? We fine-tune a 70 billion parameter LLM to generate statements that maximize the expected approval for a group of people with potentially diverse opinions. Human participants provide written opinions on thousands of questions touching on moral and political issues (e.g., 'should we raise taxes on the rich?'), and rate the LLM's generated candidate consensus statements for agreement and quality. A reward model is then trained to predict individual preferences, enabling it to quantify and rank consensus statements in terms of their appeal to the overall group, defined according to different aggregation (social welfare) functions. The model produces consensus statements that are preferred by human users over those from prompted LLMs (>70%) and significantly outperforms a tight fine-tuned baseline that lacks the final ranking step. Further, our best model's consensus statements are preferred over the best human-generated opinions (>65%). We find that when we silently constructed consensus statements from only a subset of group members, those who were excluded were more likely to dissent, revealing the sensitivity of the consensus to individual contributions. These results highlight the potential to use LLMs to help groups of humans align their values with one another.","No"
"Refined Semantic Enhancement towards Frequency Diffusion for Video Captioning","Xian Zhong, Zipeng Li, Shuqin Chen, Kui Jiang, Chen Chen and Mang Ye",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15076","Video captioning aims to generate natural language sentences that describe the given video accurately. Existing methods obtain favorable generation by exploring richer visual representations in encode phase or improving the decoding ability. However, the long-tailed problem hinders these attempts at low-frequency tokens, which rarely occur but carry critical semantics, playing a vital role in the detailed generation. In this paper, we introduce a novel Refined Semantic enhancement method towards Frequency Diffusion (RSFD), a captioning model that constantly perceives the linguistic representation of the infrequent tokens. Concretely, a Frequency-Aware Diffusion (FAD) module is proposed to comprehend the semantics of low-frequency tokens to break through generation limitations. In this way, the caption is refined by promoting the absorption of tokens with insufficient occurrence. Based on FAD, we design a Divergent Semantic Supervisor (DSS) module to compensate for the information loss of high-frequency tokens brought by the diffusion process, where the semantics of low-frequency tokens is further emphasized to alleviate the long-tailed problem. Extensive experiments indicate that RSFD outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, i.e., MSR-VTT and MSVD, demonstrate that the enhancement of low-frequency tokens semantics can obtain a competitive generation effect.

Several long-tail hashing methods have been proposed but they can not adapt for multi-modal data, due to the complex interplay between labels and individuality and commonality information of multi-modal data. Furthermore, CMH methods mostly mine the commonality of multi-modal data to learn hash codes, which may override tail labels encoded by the individuality of respective modalities. In this paper, we propose LtCMH (Long-tail CMH) to handle imbalanced multi-modal data. LtCMH firstly adopts auto-encoders to mine the individuality and commonality of different modalities by minimizing the dependency between the individuality of respective modalities and by enhancing the commonality of these modalities. Then it dynamically combines the individuality and commonality with direct features extracted from respective modalities to create meta features that enrich the representation of tail labels, and binaries meta features to generate hash codes. LtCMH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on long-tail datasets and holds a better (or comparable) performance on datasets with balanced labels.","No"

Based on the observation that most textual comments of an image are about objects and their interactions rather than aspects of aesthetics, we first introduce the concept of Aesthetic Relevance Score (ARS) of a sentence and have developed a model to automatically label a sentence with its ARS. We then use the ARS to design the ARIC model which includes an ARS weighted IAC loss function and an ARS based diverse aesthetic caption selector (DACS).

Investigations with linear models","Ekin Aky\'urek, Dale Schuurmans, Jacob Andreas, Tengyu Ma, Denny Zhou",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15661","Neural sequence models, especially transformers, exhibit a remarkable capacity for in-context learning. They can construct new predictors from sequences of labeled examples $(x, f(x))$ presented in the input without further parameter updates. We investigate the hypothesis that transformer-based in-context learners implement standard learning algorithms implicitly, by encoding smaller models in their activations, and updating these implicit models as new examples appear in the context. Using linear regression as a prototypical problem, we offer three sources of evidence for this hypothesis. First, we prove by construction that transformers can implement learning algorithms for linear models based on gradient descent and closed-form ridge regression. Second, we show that trained in-context learners closely match the predictors computed by gradient descent, ridge regression, and exact least-squares regression, transitioning between different predictors as transformer depth and dataset noise vary, and converging to Bayesian estimators for large widths and depths. Third, we present preliminary evidence that in-context learners share algorithmic features with these predictors: learners' late layers non-linearly encode weight vectors and moment matrices. These results suggest that in-context learning is understandable in algorithmic terms, and that (at least in the linear case) learners may rediscover standard estimation algorithms.

Recently, grid-tagging methods, which benefit from the flexible design of tagging systems and model architectures, have shown superiority to adapt for various information extraction tasks. In this paper, we follow the line of such methods and propose a competitive grid-tagging model for discontinuous NER. We call our model TOE because we incorporate two kinds of Tag-Oriented Enhancement mechanisms into a state-of-the-art (SOTA) grid-tagging model that casts the NER problem into word-word relationship prediction. First, we design a Tag Representation Embedding Module (TREM) to force our model to consider not only word-word relationships but also word-tag and tag-tag relationships. Concretely, we construct tag representations and embed them into TREM, so that TREM can treat tag and word representations as queries/keys/values and utilize self-attention to model their relationships. On the other hand, motivated by the Next-Neighboring-Word (NNW) and Tail-Head-Word (THW) tags in the SOTA model, we add two new symmetric tags, namely Previous-Neighboring-Word (PNW) and Head-Tail-Word (HTW), to model more fine-grained word-word relationships and alleviate error propagation from tag prediction. In the experiments of three benchmark datasets, namely CADEC, ShARe13 and ShARe14, our TOE model pushes the SOTA results by about 0.83%, 0.05% and 0.66% in F1, demonstrating its effectiveness.","No"

By annotating the dataset using new fine-grained tags, we show that solving the Winoground task requires not just compositional language understanding, but a host of other abilities like commonsense reasoning or locating small, out-of-focus objects in low-resolution images. In this paper, we identify the dataset's main challenges through a suite of experiments on related tasks (probing task, image retrieval task), data augmentation, and manual inspection of the dataset.

Most existing approaches require annotated paraphrase pairs for training and are thus costly to extend to new domains.

In this paper, we demonstrate that leveraging Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR) can greatly improve the performance of unsupervised syntactically controlled paraphrase generation. Our proposed model, AMR-enhanced Paraphrase Generator (AMRPG), separately encodes the AMR graph and the constituency parse of the input sentence into two disentangled semantic and syntactic embeddings. A decoder is then learned to reconstruct the input sentence from the semantic and syntactic embeddings. Our experiments show that AMRPG generates more accurate syntactically controlled paraphrases, both quantitatively and qualitatively, compared to the existing unsupervised approaches. We also demonstrate that the paraphrases generated by AMRPG can be used for data augmentation to improve the robustness of NLP models.","No"

We thus formalize dialect robustness and dialect awareness as goals for NLG evaluation metrics. We introduce a suite of methods and corresponding statistical tests one can use to assess metrics in light of the two goals. Applying the suite to current state-of-the-art metrics, we demonstrate that they are not dialect-robust and that semantic perturbations frequently lead to smaller decreases in a metric than the introduction of dialect features. As a first step to overcome this limitation, we propose a training schema, NANO, which introduces regional and language information to the pretraining process of a metric. We demonstrate that NANO provides a size-efficient way for models to improve the dialect robustness while simultaneously improving their performance on the standard metric benchmark.","No"

In this paper, we propose an adaptive LM fusion approach called internal language model estimation based adaptive domain adaptation (ILME-ADA). To realize such an ILME-ADA, an interpolated log-likelihood score is calculated based on the maximum of the scores from the internal LM and the external LM (ELM) respectively. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ILME-ADA method with both RNN-T and LAS modeling frameworks employing neural network and n-gram LMs as ELMs respectively on two domain specific (target) test sets.

In this paper, we cast the multi-vector retrieval problem as sparse alignment between query and document tokens. We propose AligneR, a novel multi-vector retrieval model that learns sparsified pairwise alignments between query and document tokens (e.g. `dog' vs. `puppy') and per-token unary saliences reflecting their relative importance for retrieval. We show that controlling the sparsity of pairwise token alignments often brings significant performance gains. While most factoid questions focusing on a specific part of a document require a smaller number of alignments, others requiring a broader understanding of a document favor a larger number of alignments. Unary saliences, on the other hand, decide whether a token ever needs to be aligned with others for retrieval (e.g. `kind' from `kind of currency is used in new zealand}'). With sparsified unary saliences, we are able to prune a large number of query and document token vectors and improve the efficiency of multi-vector retrieval. We learn the sparse unary saliences with entropy-regularized linear programming, which outperforms other methods to achieve sparsity. In a zero-shot setting, AligneR scores 51.1 points nDCG@10, achieving a new retriever-only state-of-the-art on 13 tasks in the BEIR benchmark. In addition, adapting pairwise alignments with a few examples (<= 8) further improves the performance up to 15.7 points nDCG@10 for argument retrieval tasks. The unary saliences of AligneR helps us to keep only 20% of the document token representations with minimal performance loss.

"Characterizing Intrinsic Compositionality In Transformers With Tree Projections","Shikhar Murty, Pratyusha Sharma, Jacob Andreas, Christopher D. Manning",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01288","When trained on language data, do transformers learn some arbitrary computation that utilizes the full capacity of the architecture or do they learn a simpler, tree-like computation, hypothesized to underlie compositional meaning systems like human languages? There is an apparent tension between compositional accounts of human language understanding, which are based on a restricted bottom-up computational process, and the enormous success of neural models like transformers, which can route information arbitrarily between different parts of their input. One possibility is that these models, while extremely flexible in principle, in practice learn to interpret language hierarchically, ultimately building sentence representations close to those predictable by a bottom-up, tree-structured model. To evaluate this possibility, we describe an unsupervised and parameter-free method to \emph{functionally project} the behavior of any transformer into the space of tree-structured networks. Given an input sentence, we produce a binary tree that approximates the transformer's representation-building process and a score that captures how 'tree-like' the transformer's behavior is on the input. While calculation of this score does not require training any additional models, it provably upper-bounds the fit between a transformer and any tree-structured approximation. Using this method, we show that transformers for three different tasks become more tree-like over the course of training, in some cases unsupervisedly recovering the same trees as supervised parsers.

Rather than computing relative frequencies as the number of occurrences of a given word divided by the total number of tokens in a text, I argue that a more efficient normalization factor is the total number of relevant tokens only. The notion of relevant words includes synonyms and, usually, a few dozen other words in some ways semantically similar to a word in question. To determine such a semantic background, one of word embedding models can be used. The proposed method outperforms classical most-frequent-word approaches substantially, usually by a few percentage points depending on the input settings.","No"
"Learning an Artificial Language for Knowledge-Sharing in Multilingual Translation","Danni Liu, Jan Niehues",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01292","The cornerstone of multilingual neural translation is shared representations across languages. Given the theoretically infinite representation power of neural networks, semantically identical sentences are likely represented differently. While representing sentences in the continuous latent space ensures expressiveness, it introduces the risk of capturing of irrelevant features which hinders the learning of a common representation. In this work, we discretize the encoder output latent space of multilingual models by assigning encoder states to entries in a codebook, which in effect represents source sentences in a new artificial language. This discretization process not only offers a new way to interpret the otherwise black-box model representations, but, more importantly, gives potential for increasing robustness in unseen testing conditions. We validate our approach on large-scale experiments with realistic data volumes and domains. When tested in zero-shot conditions, our approach is competitive with two strong alternatives from the literature. We also use the learned artificial language to analyze model behavior, and discover that using a similar bridge language increases knowledge-sharing among the remaining languages.","No"
"Improving Named Entity Recognition in Telephone Conversations via Effective Active Learning with Human in the Loop","Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Cheng Chen, Xue-Yong Fu, Shashi Bhushan TN",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01354","Telephone transcription data can be very noisy due to speech recognition errors, disfluencies, etc. Not only that annotating such data is very challenging for the annotators, but also such data may have lots of annotation errors even after the annotation job is completed, resulting in a very poor model performance. In this paper, we present an active learning framework that leverages human in the loop learning to identify data samples from the annotated dataset for re-annotation that are more likely to contain annotation errors. In this way, we largely reduce the need for data re-annotation for the whole dataset. We conduct extensive experiments with our proposed approach for Named Entity Recognition and observe that by re-annotating only about 6% training instances out of the whole dataset, the F1 score for a certain entity type can be significantly improved by about 25%.","No"

"CascadeXML: Rethinking Transformers for End-to-end Multi-resolution Training in Extreme Multi-label Classification","Siddhant Kharbanda and Atmadeep Banerjee and Erik Schultheis and Rohit Babbar",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00640","Extreme Multi-label Text Classification (XMC) involves learning a classifier that can assign an input with a subset of most relevant labels from millions of label choices. Recent approaches, such as XR-Transformer and LightXML, leverage a transformer instance to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, in this process, these approaches need to make various trade-offs between performance and computational requirements. A major shortcoming, as compared to the Bi-LSTM based AttentionXML, is that they fail to keep separate feature representations for each resolution in a label tree. We thus propose CascadeXML, an end-to-end multi-resolution learning pipeline, which can harness the multi-layered architecture of a transformer model for attending to different label resolutions with separate feature representations. CascadeXML significantly outperforms all existing approaches with non-trivial gains obtained on benchmark datasets consisting of up to three million labels.

One can find any attributes or other information of a wiki item on a wiki page edited by a community of volunteers. However, the traditional text along with images can hardly express some other aspects of an item. For example, when we talk about 'Shiba Inu', one may care more about 'How to feed it' or 'How to train it to not protect its food'. Currently, short-video platforms have become a hallmark in the online world. Whether you're on TikTok, Instagram, Kuaishou, or YouTube Shorts, short-video apps have changed how we consume and create content today. Except for entertainment short videos, we can find more and more authors sharing insightful knowledge widely across all walks of life. These short videos, which we call knowledge videos, can easily express any aspects (E.g. hair or how-to-feed) consumers want to know about an item (E.g. Shiba Inu), and they can be systematically analyzed and organized like an online encyclopedia. In this paper, we propose Kuaipedia, a massive multi-modal encyclopedia consisting of items, aspects, and short videos linking to them, which is extracted from billions of videos of Kuaishou, a well-known short-video platform in China. We first collected items from multiple sources and mined user-centered aspects from millions of users' queries to build an item-aspect tree. Then we propose a new task called 'multi-modal item-aspect linking' as an expansion of 'entity linking' to link short videos into item-aspect pairs and build the whole short video encyclopedia. Intrinsic evaluations show that our encyclopedia is of large scale and highly accurate.","No"

In this work, we propose a method to jointly train the ASR and EP tasks in a single end-to-end (E2E) multitask model, improving EP quality by optionally leveraging information from the ASR audio encoder. We introduce a 'switch' connection, which trains the EP to consume either the audio frames directly or low-level latent representations from the ASR model. This results in a single E2E model that can be used during inference to perform frame filtering at low cost, and also make high quality end-of-query (EOQ) predictions based on ongoing ASR computation. We present results on a voice search test set showing that, compared to separate single-task models, this approach reduces median endpoint latency by 120 ms (30.8% reduction), and 90th percentile latency by 170 ms (23.0% reduction), without regressing word error rate.

Integrating a large-scale pre-trained language model (LM) into E2E-ASR has been actively studied, aiming to utilize versatile linguistic knowledge for generating accurate text. One crucial factor that makes this integration challenging lies in the vocabulary mismatch; the vocabulary constructed for a pre-trained LM is generally too large for E2E-ASR training and is likely to have a mismatch against a target ASR domain. To overcome such an issue, we propose BECTRA, an extended version of our previous BERT-CTC, that realizes BERT-based E2E-ASR using a vocabulary of interest. BECTRA is a transducer-based model, which adopts BERT-CTC for its encoder and trains an ASR-specific decoder using a vocabulary suitable for a target task. With the combination of the transducer and BERT-CTC, we also propose a novel inference algorithm for taking advantage of both autoregressive and non-autoregressive decoding. Experimental results on several ASR tasks, varying in amounts of data, speaking styles, and languages, demonstrate that BECTRA outperforms BERT-CTC by effectively dealing with the vocabulary mismatch while exploiting BERT knowledge.","No"
"InterMPL: Momentum Pseudo-Labeling with Intermediate CTC Loss","Yosuke Higuchi, Tetsuji Ogawa, Tetsunori Kobayashi, Shinji Watanabe",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00795","This paper presents InterMPL, a semi-supervised learning method of end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) that performs pseudo-labeling (PL) with intermediate supervision. Momentum PL (MPL) trains a connectionist temporal classification (CTC)-based model on unlabeled data by continuously generating pseudo-labels on the fly and improving their quality. In contrast to autoregressive formulations, such as the attention-based encoder-decoder and transducer, CTC is well suited for MPL, or PL-based semi-supervised ASR in general, owing to its simple/fast inference algorithm and robustness against generating collapsed labels. However, CTC generally yields inferior performance than the autoregressive models due to the conditional independence assumption, thereby limiting the performance of MPL. We propose to enhance MPL by introducing intermediate loss, inspired by the recent advances in CTC-based modeling. Specifically, we focus on self-conditional and hierarchical conditional CTC, that apply auxiliary CTC losses to intermediate layers such that the conditional independence assumption is explicitly relaxed. We also explore how pseudo-labels should be generated and used as supervision for intermediate losses. Experimental results in different semi-supervised settings demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms MPL and improves an ASR model by up to a 12.1% absolute performance gain. In addition, our detailed analysis validates the importance of the intermediate loss.","No"
"SIMD-size aware weight regularization for fast neural vocoding on CPU","Hiroki Kanagawa and Yusuke Ijima",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00898","This paper proposes weight regularization for a faster neural vocoder. Pruning time-consuming DNN modules is a promising way to realize a real-time vocoder on a CPU (e.g. WaveRNN, LPCNet). Regularization that encourages sparsity is also effective in avoiding the quality degradation created by pruning. However, the orders of weight matrices must be contiguous in SIMD size for fast vocoding. To ensure this order, we propose explicit SIMD size aware regularization. Our proposed method reshapes a weight matrix into a tensor so that the weights are aligned by group size in advance, and then computes the group Lasso-like regularization loss. Experiments on 70% sparse subband WaveRNN show that pruning in conventional Lasso and column-wise group Lasso degrades the synthetic speech's naturalness. The vocoder with proposed regularization 1) achieves comparable naturalness to that without pruning and 2) performs meaningfully faster than other conventional vocoders using regularization.","No"

The SpeechBlender utilizes varieties of masks to target different regions of a phonetic unit, and use the mixing factors to linearly interpolate raw speech signals while generating erroneous pronunciation instances. The masks facilitate smooth blending of the signals, thus generating more effective samples than the `Cut/Paste' method. We show the effectiveness of our augmentation technique in a phoneme-level pronunciation quality assessment task, leveraging only a good pronunciation dataset. With SpeechBlender augmentation, we observed a 3% and 2% increase in Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) compared to no-augmentation and goodness of pronunciation augmentation scenarios respectively for Speechocean762 testset. Moreover, a 2% rise in PCC is observed when comparing our single-task phoneme-level mispronunciation detection model with a multi-task learning model using multiple-granularity information.","No"

However, most existing methods require the structures of two monolingual ASR models (MAMs) should be the same and only use the encoder of MAMs. This leads to the problem that pre-trained MAMs cannot be timely and fully used for CS ASR. In this paper, we propose a monolingual recognizers fusion method for CS ASR. It has two stages: the speech awareness (SA) stage and the language fusion (LF) stage. In the SA stage, acoustic features are mapped to two language-specific predictions by two independent MAMs. To keep the MAMs focused on their own language, we further extend the language-aware training strategy for the MAMs. In the LF stage, the BELM fuses two language-specific predictions to get the final prediction. Moreover, we propose a text simulation strategy to simplify the training process of the BELM and reduce reliance on CS data. Experiments on a Mandarin-English corpus show the efficiency of the proposed method. The mix error rate is significantly reduced on the test set after using open-source pre-trained MAMs.","No"

Some of these difficulties can be alleviated by an approach that takes diagrams seriously as mathematical formalisms in their own right. Stock & flow diagrams are widely used as broadly accessible building blocks for infectious disease modeling. In this chapter, rather than focusing on the underlying mathematics, we informally use communicable disease examples created by the implemented software of StockFlow.jl to explain the basics, characteristics, and benefits of the categorical framework. We first characterize categorical stock & flow diagrams, and note the clear separation between the syntax of stock & flow diagrams and their semantics, demonstrating three examples of semantics already implemented in the software: ODEs, causal loop diagrams, and system structure diagrams. We then establish composition and stratification frameworks and examples for stock & flow diagrams. Applying category theory, these frameworks can build large diagrams from smaller ones in a modular fashion. Finally, we introduce the open-source ModelCollab software for diagram-centric real-time collaborative modeling.

In this paper, we address this gap, showing that an attractor-based end-to-end system can also perform remarkably well in the latter scenario when first pre-trained on a carefully-designed simulated dataset that matches the distribution of in-the-wild recordings. We also propose to use an attention mechanism to increase the network capacity in decoding more speaker attractors, and to jointly train the attractors on a speaker recognition task to improve the speaker attractor representation.

However, while the publicly available CLIP models are mostly pretrained on English data, it is hard to search for a CLIP pretrained on Chinese data. We assume that pretraining a Chinese CLIP is essential to research and industry for the following reasons. First, it can benefit the vision-language retrieval in Chinese and thus promote the language-specific multimodal representation learning. Second, the distribution of images in Chinese websites should be different from that of images in English websites. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset of image-text pairs in Chinese, where most data are retrieved from publicly available datasets, and we pretrain Chinese CLIP models on the new dataset.

"Lifelong and Continual Learning Dialogue Systems","Sahisnu Mazumder, Bing Liu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06553","Dialogue systems, commonly known as chatbots, have gained escalating popularity in recent times due to their wide-spread applications in carrying out chit-chat conversations with users and task-oriented dialogues to accomplish various user tasks. Existing chatbots are usually trained from pre-collected and manually-labeled data and/or written with handcrafted rules. Many also use manually-compiled knowledge bases (KBs). Their ability to understand natural language is still limited, and they tend to produce many errors resulting in poor user satisfaction. Typically, they need to be constantly improved by engineers with more labeled data and more manually compiled knowledge. This book introduces the new paradigm of lifelong learning dialogue systems to endow chatbots the ability to learn continually by themselves through their own self-initiated interactions with their users and working environments to improve themselves. As the systems chat more and more with users or learn more and more from external sources, they become more and more knowledgeable and better and better at conversing. The book presents the latest developments and techniques for building such continual learning dialogue systems that continuously learn new language expressions and lexical and factual knowledge during conversation from users and off conversation from external sources, acquire new training examples during conversation, and learn conversational skills. Apart from these general topics, existing works on continual learning of some specific aspects of dialogue systems are also surveyed.

"Few-shot Multimodal Sentiment Analysis based on Multimodal Probabilistic Fusion Prompts","Xiaocui Yang, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Pengfei Hong, Soujanya Poria",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06607","Multimodal sentiment analysis is a trending topic with the explosion of multimodal content on the web. Present studies in multimodal sentiment analysis rely on large-scale supervised data. Collating supervised data is time-consuming and labor-intensive. As such, it is essential to investigate the problem of few-shot multimodal sentiment analysis. Previous works in few-shot models generally use language model prompts, which can improve performance in low-resource settings. However, the textual prompt ignores the information from other modalities. We propose Multimodal Probabilistic Fusion Prompts, which can provide diverse cues for multimodal sentiment detection. We first design a unified multimodal prompt to reduce the discrepancy in different modal prompts. To improve the robustness of our model, we then leverage multiple diverse prompts for each input and propose a probabilistic method to fuse the output predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach.","No"

We present ConceptX, a human-in-the-loop framework for interpreting and annotating latent representational space in pre-trained Language Models (pLMs). We use an unsupervised method to discover concepts learned in these models and enable a graphical interface for humans to generate explanations for the concepts. To facilitate the process, we provide auto-annotations of the concepts (based on traditional linguistic ontologies). Such annotations enable development of a linguistic resource that directly represents latent concepts learned within deep NLP models. These include not just traditional linguistic concepts, but also task-specific or sensitive concepts (words grouped based on gender or religious connotation) that helps the annotators to mark bias in the model. The framework consists of two parts (i) concept discovery and (ii) annotation platform.","No"

Essentially, we fine-tune the generative language model GPT-2 to synthesize labeled text with the original training data. More specifically, We propose a teacher-student framework where we first pre-train a teacher model on the original data, and then train a student model on the GPT-augmented data under the guidance of the teacher.

Despite extensively reducing the number of tunable parameters and achieving satisfying performance, PT is training-inefficient due to its slow convergence. To improve PT's training efficiency, we first make some novel observations about the prompt transferability of 'partial PLMs', which are defined by compressing a PLM in depth or width. We observe that the soft prompts learned by different partial PLMs of various sizes are similar in the parameter space, implying that these soft prompts could potentially be transferred among partial PLMs. Inspired by these observations, we propose Fast Prompt Tuning (FPT), which starts by conducting PT using a small-scale partial PLM, and then progressively expands its depth and width until the full-model size. After each expansion, we recycle the previously learned soft prompts as initialization for the enlarged partial PLM and then proceed PT. We demonstrate the feasibility of FPT on 5 tasks and show that FPT could save over 30% training computations while achieving comparable performance.","No"
"Conversational Pattern Mining using Motif Detection","Nicolle Garber, Vukosi Marivate",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06846","The subject of conversational mining has become of great interest recently due to the explosion of social and other online media.

An interesting domain to analyse is conversations in terms of complexity and value. Complexity arises due to the fact that a conversation can be asynchronous and can involve multiple parties. It is also computationally intensive to process. We use unsupervised methods in our work in order to develop a conversational pattern mining technique which does not require time consuming, knowledge demanding and resource intensive labelling exercises. The task of identifying repeating patterns in sequences is well researched in the Bioinformatics field. In our work, we adapt this to the field of Natural Language Processing and make several extensions to a motif detection algorithm.

The recently emerged ONE2SET paradigm (Ye et al., 2021) generates keyphrases as a set and has achieved competitive performance. Nevertheless, we observe serious calibration errors outputted by ONE2SET, especially in the over-estimation of $\varnothing$ token (means 'no corresponding keyphrase'). In this paper, we deeply analyze this limitation and identify two main reasons behind: 1) the parallel generation has to introduce excessive $\varnothing$ as padding tokens into training instances; and 2) the training mechanism assigning target to each slot is unstable and further aggravates the $\varnothing$ token over-estimation. To make the model well-calibrated, we propose WR-ONE2SET which extends ONE2SET with an adaptive instance-level cost Weighting strategy and a target Re-assignment mechanism. The former dynamically penalizes the over-estimated slots for different instances thus smoothing the uneven training distribution. The latter refines the original inappropriate assignment and reduces the supervisory signals of over-estimated slots. Experimental results on commonly-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our proposed paradigm.","No"

First, we present a Dual-scale Thinnable 1-bit-Architecture to recover the representation capability of the binarized computation units by dual-scale activation binarization and liberate the speedup potential from an overall architecture perspective. Second, we also construct a Frequency Independent Distillation scheme for KWS binarization-aware training, which distills the high and low-frequency components independently to mitigate the information mismatch between full-precision and binarized representations.

"'World Knowledge' in Multiple Choice Reading Comprehension","Adian Liusie, Vatsal Raina, Mark Gales",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07040","Recently it has been shown that without any access to the contextual passage, multiple choice reading comprehension (MCRC) systems are able to answer questions significantly better than random on average. These systems use their accumulated 'world knowledge' to directly answer questions, rather than using information from the passage. This paper examines the possibility of exploiting this observation as a tool for test designers to ensure that the use of 'world knowledge' is acceptable for a particular set of questions. We propose information-theory based metrics that enable the level of 'world knowledge' exploited by systems to be assessed. Two metrics are described: the expected number of options, which measures whether a passage-free system can identify the answer a question using world knowledge; and the contextual mutual information, which measures the importance of context for a given question. We demonstrate that questions with low expected number of options, and hence answerable by the shortcut system, are often similarly answerable by humans without context. This highlights that the general knowledge 'shortcuts' could be equally used by exam candidates, and that our proposed metrics may be helpful for future test designers to monitor the quality of questions.","No"

We assess the sensitivity score on a set of representative words in the test set using two classifiers trained for hospital readmission classification with similar performance statistics. Our experiments compare the decision-making logic of clinicians and classifiers based on rank correlations of sensitivity scores.

To provide these degrees of freedom, we present a controllable citation generation system. In data from a large corpus, we first parse the attributes of each citation sentence and use these as additional input sources during training of the BART-based abstractive summarizer.

However, the result of existing methods is still far from satisfactory. Previous works indicated that omission is a major factor in affecting the quality of summarization, but few of them have further explored the omission problem, such as how omission affects summarization results and how to detect omission, which is critical for reducing omission and improving summarization quality. Moreover, analyzing and detecting omission relies on summarization datasets with omission labels (i.e., which dialogue utterances are omitted in the summarization), which are not available in the current literature. In this paper, we propose the OLDS dataset, which provides high-quality Omission Labels for Dialogue Summarization. By analyzing this dataset, we find that a large improvement in summarization quality can be achieved by providing ground-truth omission labels for the summarization model to recover omission information, which demonstrates the importance of omission detection for omission mitigation in dialogue summarization. Therefore, we formulate an omission detection task and demonstrate our proposed dataset can support the training and evaluation of this task well.

To understand such a phenomenon, we first conduct both empirical and theoretical analysis and then attribute it to representation degeneration caused by the attentive mixture of the hidden states during training. We term this process the Trap of Mediocrity. To escape from such a trap, we introduce a novel attention regularization loss to control the sharpness of the attention distribution, which is transparent to model structures and can be easily implemented within 20 lines of python code.

However, this approach is typically more expensive than traditional fine-tuning because of the necessity to generate adversarial examples via gradient descent. Delving into the optimization process of adversarial training, we find that robust connectivity patterns emerge in the early training phase (typically $0.15\sim0.3$ epochs), far before parameters converge. Inspired by this finding, we dig out robust early-bird tickets (i.e., subnetworks) to develop an efficient adversarial training method: (1) searching for robust tickets with structured sparsity in the early stage; (2) fine-tuning robust tickets in the remaining time. To extract the robust tickets as early as possible, we design a ticket convergence metric to automatically terminate the searching process. Experiments show that the proposed efficient adversarial training method can achieve up to $7\times \sim 13 \times$ training speedups while maintaining comparable or even better robustness compared to the most competitive state-of-the-art adversarial training methods.","No"

Different types of event relations naturally interact with each other, but existing datasets only cover limited relation types at once, which prevents models from taking full advantage of relation interactions.

In particular, we show how to reduce tetratagging, a state-of-the-art constituency tagger, to shift--reduce parsing by performing a right-corner transformation on the grammar and making a specific independence assumption. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate our taxonomy of tagging pipelines with different choices of linearizers, learners, and decoders. Based on the results in English and a set of 8 typologically diverse languages, we conclude that the linearization of the derivation tree and its alignment with the input sequence is the most critical factor in achieving accurate taggers.","No"
"Finding Skill Neurons in Pre-trained Transformer-based Language Models","Xiaozhi Wang, Kaiyue Wen, Zhengyan Zhang, Lei Hou, Zhiyuan Liu, Juanzi Li",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07349","Transformer-based pre-trained language models have demonstrated superior performance on various natural language processing tasks. However, it remains unclear how the skills required to handle these tasks distribute among model parameters. In this paper, we find that after prompt tuning for specific tasks, the activations of some neurons within pre-trained Transformers are highly predictive of the task labels. We dub these neurons skill neurons and confirm they encode task-specific skills by finding that: (1) Skill neurons are crucial for handling tasks. Performances of pre-trained Transformers on a task significantly drop when corresponding skill neurons are perturbed. (2) Skill neurons are task-specific. Similar tasks tend to have similar distributions of skill neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate the skill neurons are most likely generated in pre-training rather than fine-tuning by showing that the skill neurons found with prompt tuning are also crucial for other fine-tuning methods freezing neuron weights, such as the adapter-based tuning and BitFit. We also explore the applications of skill neurons, including accelerating Transformers with network pruning and building better transferability indicators. These findings may promote further research on understanding Transformers. The source code can be obtained from https://github.com/THU-KEG/Skill-Neuron.","No"
"Does Debiasing Inevitably Degrade the Model Performance","Yiran Liu, Xiao Liu, Haotian Chen and Yang Yu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07350","Gender bias in language models has attracted sufficient attention because it threatens social justice. However, most of the current debiasing methods degraded the model's performance on other tasks while the degradation mechanism is still mysterious. We propose a theoretical framework explaining the three candidate mechanisms of the language model's gender bias. We use our theoretical framework to explain why the current debiasing methods cause performance degradation. We also discover a pathway through which debiasing will not degrade the model performance. We further develop a causality-detection fine-tuning approach to correct gender bias. The numerical experiment demonstrates that our method is able to lead to double dividends: partially mitigating gender bias while avoiding performance degradation.","No"
"Multi-VQG: Generating Engaging Questions for Multiple Images","Min-Hsuan Yeh, Vicent Chen, Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Haung, Lun-Wei Ku",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07441","Generating engaging content has drawn much recent attention in the NLP community. Asking questions is a natural way to respond to photos and promote awareness. However, most answers to questions in traditional question-answering (QA) datasets are factoids, which reduce individuals' willingness to answer. Furthermore, traditional visual question generation (VQG) confines the source data for question generation to single images, resulting in a limited ability to comprehend time-series information of the underlying event. In this paper, we propose generating engaging questions from multiple images. We present MVQG, a new dataset, and establish a series of baselines, including both end-to-end and dual-stage architectures. Results show that building stories behind the image sequence enables models to generate engaging questions, which confirms our assumption that people typically construct a picture of the event in their minds before asking questions. These results open up an exciting challenge for visual-and-language models to implicitly construct a story behind a series of photos to allow for creativity and experience sharing and hence draw attention to downstream applications.","No"
"Calibrated Interpretation: Confidence Estimation in Semantic Parsing","Elias Stengel-Eskin and Benjamin Van Durme",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07443","Task-oriented semantic parsing is increasingly being used in user-facing applications, making measuring the calibration of parsing models especially important. We examine the calibration characteristics of six models across three model families on two common English semantic parsing datasets, finding that many models are reasonably well-calibrated and that there is a trade-off between calibration and performance. Based on confidence scores across three models, we propose and release new challenge splits of the two datasets we examine. We then illustrate the ways a calibrated model can be useful in balancing common trade-offs in task-oriented parsing. In a simulated annotator-in-the-loop experiment, we show that using model confidence allows us to improve performance by 9.6% (absolute) with interactions on only 2.2% of tokens. Using sequence-level confidence scores, we then examine how we can optimize trade-off between a parser's usability and safety. We show that confidence-based thresholding can reduce the number of incorrect low-confidence programs executed by 76%; however, this comes at a cost to usability. We propose the DidYouMean system which balances usability and safety. We conclude by calling for calibration to be included in the evaluation of semantic parsing systems, and release a library for computing calibration metrics.","No"
"Towards Robust Numerical Question Answering: Diagnosing Numerical Capabilities of NLP Systems","Jialiang Xu, Mengyu Zhou, Xinyi He, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07455","Numerical Question Answering is the task of answering questions that require numerical capabilities. Previous works introduce general adversarial attacks to Numerical Question Answering, while not systematically exploring numerical capabilities specific to the topic. In this paper, we propose to conduct numerical capability diagnosis on a series of Numerical Question Answering systems and datasets. A series of numerical capabilities are highlighted, and corresponding dataset perturbations are designed. Empirical results indicate that existing systems are severely challenged by these perturbations. E.g., Graph2Tree experienced a 53.83% absolute accuracy drop against the ``Extra'' perturbation on ASDiv-a, and BART experienced 13.80% accuracy drop against the ``Language'' perturbation on the numerical subset of DROP. As a counteracting approach, we also investigate the effectiveness of applying perturbations as data augmentation to relieve systems' lack of robust numerical capabilities. With experiment analysis and empirical studies, it is demonstrated that Numerical Question Answering with robust numerical capabilities is still to a large extent an open question. We discuss future directions of Numerical Question Answering and summarize guidelines on future dataset collection and system design.","No"

Yet, experienced researchers can often correctly guess from which research group an anonymous submission originates, biasing the peer-review process. In this work, we present a transformer-based, neural-network architecture that only uses the text content and the author names in the bibliography to atttribute an anonymous manuscript to an author. To train and evaluate our method, we created the largest authorship-identification dataset to date. It leverages all research papers publicly available on arXiv amounting to over 2 million manuscripts. In arXiv-subsets with up to 2,000 different authors, our method achieves an unprecedented authorship attribution accuracy, where up to 95% of papers are attributed correctly.

Recently, Few-shot Learning (FSL) and Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) have been proposed to tackle this problem. Therefore, we propose AdaptKeyBERT, a pipeline for training keyword extractors with LLM bases by incorporating the concept of regularized attention into a pre-training phase for downstream domain adaptation.

We show that CST5 generates high quality code-switched data, both intrinsically (per human evaluation) and extrinsically by comparing baseline models which are trained without data augmentation to models which are trained with augmented data. Empirically we observe that using CST5, one can achieve the same semantic parsing performance by using up to 20x less labeled data. To aid further research in this area, we are also releasing (a) Hinglish-TOP, the largest human annotated code-switched semantic parsing dataset to date, containing 10k human annotated Hindi-English (Hinglish) code-switched utterances, and (b) Over 170K CST5 generated code-switched utterances from the TOPv2 dataset.

In this work, we study the connection between explainability and sample hardness by investigating the following research question - 'Are LLMs and humans equally good at explaining data labels for both easy and hard samples?' We answer this question by first collecting human-written explanations in the form of generalizable commonsense rules on the task of Winograd Schema Challenge (Winogrande dataset). We compare these explanations with those generated by GPT-3 while varying the hardness of the test samples as well as the in-context samples. We observe that (1) GPT-3 explanations are as grammatical as human explanations regardless of the hardness of the test samples, (2) for easy examples, GPT-3 generates highly supportive explanations but human explanations are more generalizable, and (3) for hard examples, human explanations are significantly better than GPT-3 explanations both in terms of label-supportiveness and generalizability judgements. We also find that hardness of the in-context examples impacts the quality of GPT-3 explanations. Finally, we show that the supportiveness and generalizability aspects of human explanations are also impacted by sample hardness, although by a much smaller margin than models.

"Learning to Answer Multilingual and Code-Mixed Questions","Deepak Gupta",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07522","Question-answering (QA) that comes naturally to humans is a critical component in seamless human-computer interaction. It has emerged as one of the most convenient and natural methods to interact with the web and is especially desirable in voice-controlled environments. Despite being one of the oldest research areas, the current QA system faces the critical challenge of handling multilingual queries. To build an Artificial Intelligent (AI) agent that can serve multilingual end users, a QA system is required to be language versatile and tailored to suit the multilingual environment. Recent advances in QA models have enabled surpassing human performance primarily due to the availability of a sizable amount of high-quality datasets. However, the majority of such annotated datasets are expensive to create and are only confined to the English language, making it challenging to acknowledge progress in foreign languages. Therefore, to measure a similar improvement in the multilingual QA system, it is necessary to invest in high-quality multilingual evaluation benchmarks. In this dissertation, we focus on advancing QA techniques for handling end-user queries in multilingual environments. This dissertation consists of two parts. In the first part, we explore multilingualism and a new dimension of multilingualism referred to as code-mixing. Second, we propose a technique to solve the task of multi-hop question generation by exploiting multiple documents. Experiments show our models achieve state-of-the-art performance on answer extraction, ranking, and generation tasks on multiple domains of MQA, VQA, and language generation. The proposed techniques are generic and can be widely used in various domains and languages to advance QA systems.","No"

It is a thriving activity today, however formalisation remains cumbersome. In this paper, we explore the abilities of a large language model (Codex) to help with formalisation in the Lean theorem prover. We find that with careful input-dependent prompt selection and postprocessing, Codex is able to formalise short mathematical statements at undergrad level with nearly 75\% accuracy for $120$ theorem statements. For proofs quantitative analysis is infeasible and we undertake a detailed case study. We choose a diverse set of $13$ theorems at undergrad level with proofs that fit in two-three paragraphs. We show that with a new prompting strategy Codex can formalise these proofs in natural language with at least one out of twelve Codex completion being easy to repair into a complete proof. This is surprising as essentially no aligned data exists for formalised mathematics, particularly for proofs. These results suggest that large language models are a promising avenue towards fully or partially automating formalisation.","No"

In this work we investigate the validity of this approach, and we specifically focus on two well-known NLP tasks for our empirical investigations: POS-tagging and machine translation. We show that down sampling from a high-resource language results in datasets with different properties than the low-resource datasets, impacting the model performance for both POS-tagging and machine translation. Based on these results we conclude that naive down sampling of datasets results in a biased view of how well these systems work in a low-resource scenario.","No"

Curved Contrastive Learning for Abstract Sequence Modeling Utilized on Long Short-Term Dialogue Planning","Justus-Jonas Erker, Gerasimos Spanakis, Stefan Schaffer",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07591","Motivated by the entailment property of multi-turn dialogues through contrastive learning sentence embeddings, we introduce a novel technique, Curved Contrastive Learning (CCL), for generating semantically meaningful and conversational graph curved utterance embeddings that can be compared using cosine similarity. The resulting bi-encoder models can guide transformers as a response ranking model towards a goal in a zero-shot fashion by projecting the goal utterance and the corresponding reply candidates into a latent space. Here the cosine similarity indicates the distance/reachability of a candidate utterance towards the corresponding goal which we define as curved space. Furthermore, we explore how these forward-entailing language representations can be utilized for assessing the likelihood of sequences by the entailment strength i.e. through the cosine similarity of its individual members (encoded separately) as an emergent property in the curved space. This allows us to imagine the likelihood of future patterns in dialogues, specifically by ordering/identifying future goal utterances that are multiple turns away, given a dialogue context. As part of our analysis, we investigate characteristics that make conversations (un)plannable and find strong evidence of planning capability over multiple turns (in 61.56\% over 3 turns) in conversations from the DailyDialog dataset. Finally, we will show how we can exploit the curved property to rank one million utterance & context pairs, in terms of GPU computation time over 7 million times faster than DialogRPT, while being in average 2.8\% qualitatively superior for sequences longer than 2 turns.","No"

These users are hesitant to explore using the smartphone and rely on experienced users to teach them how to use the phone. However, experienced users are not always around to guide them. To help new users learn how to use the phone on their own, we propose a natural language based instruction following agent that operates over the UI and shows the user how to perform various tasks. Common how-to questions, such as 'How to block calls from unknown numbers?', are documented on support sites with a sequence of steps in natural language describing what the user should do. We parse these steps using Large Language Models (LLMs) and generate macros that can be executed on-device when the user asks a query. To evaluate this agent, we introduce UGIF-DataSet, a multi-lingual, multi-modal UI grounded dataset for step-by-step task completion on the smartphone. It contains 523 natural language instructions with paired sequences of multilingual UI screens and actions that show how to execute the task in eight languages. We compare the performance of different large language models including PaLM, GPT3, etc. and find that the end-to-end task completion success rate is 48% for English UI but the performance drops to 32% for non-English languages.

Greedy and beam search are known to suffer from text degeneration and linguistic diversity issues, while temperature, top-k, and nucleus sampling often yield diverse but low-quality outputs. In this work, we present crowd sampling, a family of decoding methods based on Bayesian risk minimization, to address this diversity-quality trade-off. Inspired by the principle of 'the wisdom of the crowd,' crowd sampling seeks to select a candidate from a pool of candidates that has the least expected risk (i.e., highest expected reward) under a generative model according to a given utility function. Crowd sampling can be seen as a generalization of numerous existing methods, including majority voting, and in practice, it can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing sampling methods. Extensive experiments show that crowd sampling delivers improvements of 3-7 ROUGE and BLEU points across a wide range of tasks, including summarization, data-to-text, translation, and textual style transfer, while achieving new state-of-the-art results on WebNLG and WMT'16.","No"

Existing works generally ignore the correlation between prosody and language content, leading to the degradation of naturalness in converted speech. Additionally, the lack of proper language features prevents these systems from accurately preserving language content after conversion. To address these issues, we devise a cascaded modular system leveraging self-supervised discrete speech units as language representation. These discrete units provide duration information essential for rhythm modeling. Our system first extracts utterance-level prosody and speaker representations from the raw waveform. Given the prosody representation, a prosody predictor estimates pitch, energy, and duration for each discrete unit in the utterance. A synthesizer further reconstructs speech based on the predicted prosody, speaker representation, and discrete units. Experiments show that our system outperforms previous approaches in naturalness, intelligibility, speaker transferability, and prosody transferability. Code and samples are publicly available.","No"

Existing models, such as HuBERT, however, can be fairly large thus may not be suitable for edge speech applications. Moreover, realistic applications typically involve speech corrupted by noise and room reverberation, hence models need to provide representations that are robust to such environmental factors. In this study, we build on the so-called DistilHuBERT model, which distils HuBERT to a fraction of its original size, with three modifications, namely: (i) augment the training data with noise and reverberation, while the student model needs to distill the clean representations from the teacher model; (ii) introduce a curriculum learning approach where increasing levels of noise are introduced as the model trains, thus helping with convergence and with the creation of more robust representations; and (iii) introduce a multi-task learning approach where the model also reconstructs the clean waveform jointly with the distillation task, thus also acting as an enhancement step to ensure additional environment robustness to the representation. Experiments on three SUPERB tasks show the advantages of the proposed method not only relative to the original DistilHuBERT, but also to the original HuBERT, thus showing the advantages of the proposed method for ``in the wild'' edge speech applications.","No"

To address this problem, we explore the semantic alignment between text and image representations by learning to match their semantic levels in the GAN-based generative model. More specifically, we introduce dynamic interactions according to learning to dynamically explore various semantic depths and fuse the different-modal information at a matched semantic level, which thus relieves the text-image semantic misalignment problem. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate the improvements of our approach, neither using segmentation masks nor auxiliary captioning networks, on image quality and story consistency, compared with state-of-the-art methods.","No"

Several datasets for SER are available in the literature. However most of them are in English or Chinese, have been recorded while actors and actresses pronounce short phrases and thus are not related to natural conversation. Moreover only few speeches among all the databases are related to elderly people. Therefore, in this work, a multi-language and multi-age corpus is considered merging a dataset in English, that includes also elderly people, with a dataset in Italian. A general model, trained on young and adult English actors and actresses is proposed, based on XGBoost. Then two strategies of domain adaptation are proposed to adapt the model either to elderly people and to Italian speakers. The results suggest that this approach increases the classification performance, underlining also that new datasets should be collected.","No"

The feasibility of deploying automated tools that can classify language samples obtained from speech in large-scale clinical settings depends on the ability to capture and automatically transcribe the speech for subsequent analysis. However, the impressive performance of self-supervised learning (SSL) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models with curated speech data is not apparent with challenging speech samples from clinical settings. One of the key questions for successfully applying ASR models for clinical applications is whether imperfect transcripts they generate provide sufficient information for downstream tasks to operate at an acceptable level of accuracy. In this study, we examine the relationship between the errors produced by several deep learning ASR systems and their impact on the downstream task of dementia classification. One of our key findings is that, paradoxically, ASR systems with relatively high error rates can produce transcripts that result in better downstream classification accuracy than classification based on verbatim transcripts.","No"

This paper proposes a TLS system which can interactively learn from the user's feedback via reinforcement learning and generate timelines satisfying the user's interests. We define a compound reward function that can update automatically according to the received feedback through interaction with the user. The system utilises the reward function to fine-tune an abstractive summarisation model via reinforcement learning to guarantee topical coherence, factual consistency and linguistic fluency of the generated summaries. The proposed system avoids the need of preference feedback from individual users. The experiments show that our system outperforms the baseline on the benchmark TLS dataset and can generate accurate and timeline precises that better satisfy real users.","No"
"EVA: Exploring the Limits of Masked Visual Representation Learning at Scale","Yuxin Fang, Wen Wang, Binhui Xie, Quan Sun, Ledell Wu, Xinggang Wang, Tiejun Huang, Xinlong Wang, Yue Cao",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07636","We launch EVA, a vision-centric foundation model to explore the limits of visual representation at scale using only publicly accessible data. EVA is a vanilla ViT pre-trained to reconstruct the masked out image-text aligned vision features conditioned on visible image patches. Via this pretext task, we can efficiently scale up EVA to one billion parameters, and sets new records on a broad range of representative vision downstream tasks, such as image recognition, video action recognition, object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation without heavy supervised training. Moreover, we observe quantitative changes in scaling EVA result in qualitative changes in transfer learning performance that are not present in other models. For instance, EVA takes a great leap in the challenging large vocabulary instance segmentation task: our model achieves almost the same state-of-the-art performance on LVISv1.0 dataset with over a thousand categories and COCO dataset with only eighty categories. Beyond a pure vision encoder, EVA can also serve as a vision-centric, multi-modal pivot to connect images and text. We find initializing the vision tower of a giant CLIP from EVA can greatly stabilize the training and outperform the training from scratch counterpart with much fewer samples and less compute, providing a new direction for scaling up and accelerating the costly training of multi-modal foundation models.

"CoLI-Machine Learning Approaches for Code-mixed Language Identification at the Word Level in Kannada-English Texts","H.L. Shashirekha and F. Balouchzahi and M.D. Anusha and G. Sidorov",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09847","The task of automatically identifying a language used in a given text is called Language Identification (LI). India is a multilingual country and many Indians especially youths are comfortable with Hindi and English, in addition to their local languages. Hence, they often use more than one language to post their comments on social media. Texts containing more than one language are called 'code-mixed texts' and are a good source of input for LI. Languages in these texts may be mixed at sentence level, word level or even at sub-word level. LI at word level is a sequence labeling problem where each and every word in a sentence is tagged with one of the languages in the predefined set of languages. In order to address word level LI in code-mixed Kannada-English (Kn-En) texts, this work presents i) the construction of code-mixed Kn-En dataset called CoLI-Kenglish dataset, ii) code-mixed Kn-En embedding and iii) learning models using Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and Transfer Learning (TL) approaches. Code-mixed Kn-En texts are extracted from Kannada YouTube video comments to construct CoLI-Kenglish dataset and code-mixed Kn-En embedding. The words in CoLI-Kenglish dataset are grouped into six major categories, namely, 'Kannada', 'English', 'Mixed-language', 'Name', 'Location' and 'Other'. The learning models, namely, CoLI-vectors and CoLI-ngrams based on ML, CoLI-BiLSTM based on DL and CoLI-ULMFiT based on TL approaches are built and evaluated using CoLI-Kenglish dataset. The performances of the learning models illustrated, the superiority of CoLI-ngrams model, compared to other models with a macro average F1-score of 0.64.

"ProtSi: Prototypical Siamese Network with Data Augmentation for Few-Shot Subjective Answer Evaluation","Yining Lu, Jingxi Qiu, Gaurav Gupta",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09855","Subjective answer evaluation is a time-consuming and tedious task, and the quality of the evaluation is heavily influenced by a variety of subjective personal characteristics. Instead, machine evaluation can effectively assist educators in saving time while also ensuring that evaluations are fair and realistic. However, most existing methods using regular machine learning and natural language processing techniques are generally hampered by a lack of annotated answers and poor model interpretability, making them unsuitable for real-world use. To solve these challenges, we propose ProtSi Network, a unique semi-supervised architecture that for the first time uses few-shot learning to subjective answer evaluation. To evaluate students' answers by similarity prototypes, ProtSi Network simulates the natural process of evaluator scoring answers by combining Siamese Network which consists of BERT and encoder layers with Prototypical Network. We employed an unsupervised diverse paraphrasing model ProtAugment, in order to prevent overfitting for effective few-shot text classification. By integrating contrastive learning, the discriminative text issue can be mitigated. Experiments on the Kaggle Short Scoring Dataset demonstrate that the ProtSi Network outperforms the most recent baseline models in terms of accuracy and quadratic weighted kappa.","No"
"Reducing Hallucinations in Neural Machine Translation with Feature Attribution","Jo\'el Tang, Marina Fomicheva, Lucia Specia",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09878","Neural conditional language generation models achieve the state-of-the-art in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) but are highly dependent on the quality of parallel training dataset. When trained on low-quality datasets, these models are prone to various error types, including hallucinations, i.e. outputs that are fluent, but unrelated to the source sentences. These errors are particularly dangerous, because on the surface the translation can be perceived as a correct output, especially if the reader does not understand the source language. We present a case study focusing on model understanding and regularisation to reduce hallucinations in NMT. We first use feature attribution methods to study the behaviour of an NMT model that produces hallucinations. We then leverage these methods to propose a novel loss function that substantially helps reduce hallucinations and does not require retraining the model from scratch.","No"

To help users quickly digest the key information, we propose the novel CQA summarization task that aims to create a concise summary from CQA pairs. To this end, we first design a multi-stage data annotation process and create a benchmark dataset, CoQASUM, based on the Amazon QA corpus. We then compare a collection of extractive and abstractive summarization methods and establish a strong baseline approach DedupLED for the CQA summarization task. Our experiment further confirms two key challenges, sentence-type transfer and deduplication removal, towards the CQA summarization task. Our data and code are publicly available.","No"

Using simple attention modules as well as taking one's previous activities into consideration, we empirically show that our model provides human-readable explanations of an individual's subjective preference in judging social situations. We further qualitatively evaluate the explanations generated by the model and claim that our model learns an individual's subjective orientation towards abstract moral concepts","No"

As a result, these models have achieved significantly better quality on various natural language processing tasks including machine translation. However, it remains challenging to deploy such models in real-life scenarios due to the large memory requirements and inefficient inference. In this work, we introduce a highly efficient inference framework with several optimization approaches to accelerate the computation of sparse models and cut down the memory consumption significantly. While we achieve up to 26x speed-up in terms of throughput, we also reduce the model size almost to one eighth of the original 32-bit float model by quantizing expert weights into 4-bit integers. As a result, we are able to deploy 136x larger models with 27% less cost and significantly better quality compared to the existing solutions. This enables a paradigm shift in deploying large scale multilingual MoE transformers models replacing the traditional practice of distilling teacher models into dozens of smaller models per language or task.","No"

The qualifiers form hyper-relational facts which better capture the rich and complex knowledge graph structure. For example, the relation triplet (Leonard Parker, Educated At, Harvard University) can be factually enriched by including the qualifier (End Time, 1967). Hence, we propose the task of hyper-relational extraction to extract more specific and complete facts from text. To support the task, we construct HyperRED, a large-scale and general-purpose dataset. Existing models cannot perform hyper-relational extraction as it requires a model to consider the interaction between three entities. Hence, we propose CubeRE, a cube-filling model inspired by table-filling approaches and explicitly considers the interaction between relation triplets and qualifiers. To improve model scalability and reduce negative class imbalance, we further propose a cube-pruning method. Our experiments show that CubeRE outperforms strong baselines and reveal possible directions for future research. Our code and data are available at github.com/declare-lab/HyperRED.","No"

However, generative models tend to be larger than extractive models due to the need for a decoder, run slower during inference due to auto-regressive decoder beam search, and their generated output often suffers from hallucinations. We propose to extend transformer encoders with the ability to fuse information from multiple passages, using global representation to provide cross-sample attention over all tokens across samples. Furthermore, we propose an alternative answer span probability calculation to better aggregate answer scores in the global space of all samples. Using our proposed method, we outperform the current state-of-the-art method by $2.5$ Exact Match score on the Natural Question dataset while using only $25\%$ of parameters and $35\%$ of the latency during inference, and $4.4$ Exact Match on WebQuestions dataset. When coupled with synthetic data augmentation, we outperform larger models on the TriviaQA dataset as well. The latency and parameter savings of our method make it particularly attractive for open-domain question answering, as these models are often compute-intensive.","No"

Fill-in-the-blanks problem (e.g., cloze tests) is a natural approach for gauging such knowledge. BioLAMA generates prompts for biomedical factual knowledge triples and uses the Top-k accuracy metric to evaluate different PLMs' knowledge. However, existing research has shown that such prompt-based knowledge probing methods can only probe a lower bound of knowledge. Many factors like prompt-based probing biases make the LAMA benchmark unreliable and unstable. This problem is more prominent in BioLAMA. The severe long-tailed distribution in vocabulary and large-N-M relation make the performance gap between LAMA and BioLAMA remain notable. To address these, we introduce context variance into the prompt generation and propose a new rank-change-based evaluation metric. Different from the previous known-unknown evaluation criteria, we propose the concept of 'Misunderstand' in LAMA for the first time. Through experiments on 12 PLMs, our context variance prompts and Understand-Confuse-Misunderstand (UCM) metric makes BioLAMA more friendly to large-N-M relations and rare relations.

"A Copy Mechanism for Handling Knowledge Base Elements in SPARQL Neural Machine Translation","Rose Hirigoyen, Amal Zouaq and Samuel Reyd",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10271","Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models from English to SPARQL are a promising development for SPARQL query generation. However, current architectures are unable to integrate the knowledge base (KB) schema and handle questions on knowledge resources, classes, and properties unseen during training, rendering them unusable outside the scope of topics covered in the training set. Inspired by the performance gains in natural language processing tasks, we propose to integrate a copy mechanism for neural SPARQL query generation as a way to tackle this issue. We illustrate our proposal by adding a copy layer and a dynamic knowledge base vocabulary to two Seq2Seq architectures (CNNs and Transformers). This layer makes the models copy KB elements directly from the questions, instead of generating them. We evaluate our approach on state-of-the-art datasets, including datasets referencing unknown KB elements and measure the accuracy of the copy-augmented architectures.

GENIUS is pre-trained on a large-scale textual corpus with a novel reconstruction from sketch objective using an extreme and selective masking strategy, enabling it to generate diverse and high-quality texts given sketches. Comparison with other competitive conditional language models (CLMs) reveals the superiority of GENIUS's text generation quality.

Much of this success can be attributed to prompting methods for reasoning, such as chain-of-thought, that employ LLMs for both understanding the problem description by decomposing it into steps, as well as solving each step of the problem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this sort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often make logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solution part, even when the problem is correctly decomposed. We present Program-Aided Language models (PaL): a new method that uses the LLM to understand natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a programmatic runtime such as a Python interpreter. With PaL, decomposing the natural language problem into runnable steps remains the only learning task for the LLM, while solving is delegated to the interpreter. We experiment with 12 reasoning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and other benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning, symbolic reasoning, and algorithmic problems. In all these natural language reasoning tasks, generating code using an LLM and reasoning using a Python interpreter leads to more accurate results than much larger models, and we set new state-of-the-art results in all 12 benchmarks. For example, PaL using Codex achieves state-of-the-art few-shot accuracy on the GSM benchmark of math word problems when the model is allowed only a single decoding, surpassing PaLM-540B with chain-of-thought prompting by an absolute 8% .In three reasoning tasks from the BIG-Bench Hard benchmark, PaL outperforms CoT by 11%.

Quantization can reduce memory and accelerate inference. However, for LLMs beyond 100 billion parameters, existing methods cannot maintain accuracy or do not run efficiently on hardware. We propose SmoothQuant, a training-free, accuracy-preserving, and general-purpose post-training quantization (PTQ) solution to enable 8-bit weight, 8-bit activation (W8A8) quantization for LLMs that can be implemented efficiently. We observe that systematic outliers appear at fixed activation channels. Based on the fact that weights are easy to quantize while activations are not, SmoothQuant smooths the activation outliers by migrating the quantization difficulty from activations to weights with a mathematically equivalent transformation. SmoothQuant enables an INT8 quantization of both weights and activations for all the GEMMs in LLMs, including OPT-175B, BLOOM-176B and GLM-130B. SmoothQuant has better hardware efficiency than existing techniques using mixed-precision activation quantization or weight-only quantization. We demonstrate up to 1.56x speedup and 2x memory reduction for LLMs with negligible loss in accuracy. Thanks to the hardware-friendly design, we integrate SmoothQuant into FasterTransformer, a state-of-the-art LLM serving framework, and achieve faster inference speed with half the number of GPUs compared to FP16.

Key to our approach is exploiting the joint embedding space of contrastively trained vision and language encoders. In practice, there can be systematic differences between embedding spaces for different modalities in contrastive models, and we analyze how these differences affect our approach and study a variety of strategies to mitigate this concern. We produce models using only text training data on three tasks: image captioning, visual entailment and visual question answering, and evaluate them on standard benchmarks using images. We find that this kind of transfer is possible and results in only a small drop in performance relative to models trained on images. We also showcase a variety of stylistic image captioning models that were trained using no image data and no human-curated language data, but instead text data from books, the web, or language models.","No"

Related works have queried LLMs with a wide-range of contextual information, such as goals, sensor observations and scene descriptions, to generate high-level action plans for specific tasks; however these approaches often involve human intervention or additional machinery to enable sensor-motor interactions. In this work, we propose a prompting-based strategy for extracting executable plans from an LLM, which leverages a novel and readily-accessible source of information: precondition errors. Our approach assumes that actions are only afforded execution in certain contexts, i.e., implicit preconditions must be met for an action to execute (e.g., a door must be unlocked to open it), and that the embodied agent has the ability to determine if the action is/is not executable in the current context (e.g., detect if a precondition error is present). When an agent is unable to execute an action, our approach re-prompts the LLM with precondition error information to extract an executable corrective action to achieve the intended goal in the current context. We evaluate our approach in the VirtualHome simulation environment on 88 different tasks and 7 scenes. We evaluate different prompt templates and compare to methods that naively re-sample actions from the LLM. Our approach, using precondition errors, improves executability and semantic correctness of plans, while also reducing the number of re-prompts required when querying actions.","No"

In this paper, we unify different multi-vector retrieval models from a token routing viewpoint and propose conditional token interaction via dynamic lexical routing, namely CITADEL, for efficient and effective multi-vector retrieval. CITADEL learns to route different token vectors to the predicted lexical ``keys'' such that a query token vector only interacts with document token vectors routed to the same key. This design significantly reduces the computation cost while maintaining high accuracy. Notably, CITADEL achieves the same or slightly better performance than the previous state of the art, ColBERT-v2, on both in-domain (MS MARCO) and out-of-domain (BEIR) evaluations, while being nearly 40 times faster.

"The CRINGE Loss: Learning what language not to model","Leonard Adolphs, Tianyu Gao, Jing Xu, Kurt Shuster, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Jason Weston",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05826","Standard language model training employs gold human documents or human-human interaction data, and treats all training data as positive examples. Growing evidence shows that even with very large amounts of positive training data, issues remain that can be alleviated with relatively small amounts of negative data -- examples of what the model should not do. In this work, we propose a novel procedure to train with such data called the CRINGE loss (ContRastive Iterative Negative GEneration). We show the effectiveness of this approach across three different experiments on the tasks of safe generation, contradiction avoidance, and open-domain dialogue. Our models outperform multiple strong baselines and are conceptually simple, easy to train and implement.","No"

In this work, we use a Latent Dirichlet Allocation-based pipeline for the automatic summarization and analysis of 10-years of national energy and climate plans (NECPs) for the period from 2021 to 2030, established by 27 Member States of the European Union. We focus on analyzing policy framing, the language used to describe specific issues, to detect essential nuances in the way governments frame their climate policies and achieve climate goals. The methods leverage topic modeling and clustering for the comparative analysis of policy documents across different countries. It allows for easier integration in potential user-friendly applications for the development of theories and processes of climate policy.

"Measuring Reliability of Large Language Models through Semantic Consistency","Harsh Raj, Domenic Rosati, Subhabrata Majumdar",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05853","While large pretrained language models (PLMs) demonstrate incredible fluency and performance on many natural language tasks, recent work has shown that well-performing PLMs are very sensitive to what prompts are feed into them. Even when prompts are semantically identical, language models may give very different answers. When considering safe and trustworthy deployments of PLMs we would like their outputs to be consistent under prompts that mean the same thing or convey the same intent. While some work has looked into how state-of-the-art PLMs address this need, they have been limited to only evaluating lexical equality of single- or multi-word answers and do not address consistency of generative text sequences. In order to understand consistency of PLMs under text generation settings, we develop a measure of semantic consistency that allows the comparison of open-ended text outputs. We implement several versions of this consistency metric to evaluate the performance of a number of PLMs on paraphrased versions of questions in the TruthfulQA dataset, we find that our proposed metrics are considerably more consistent than traditional metrics embodying lexical consistency, and also correlate with human evaluation of output consistency to a higher degree.","No"

To answer this question, we employ four types of pre-trained models and their combinations for SLU. We leverage self-supervised speech and language models (LM) pre-trained on large quantities of unpaired data to extract strong speech and text representations. We also explore using supervised models pre-trained on larger external automatic speech recognition (ASR) or SLU corpora.

Despite considerable research efforts in recent years for English text, the task of ED in other languages has been significantly less explored. Switching to non-English languages, important research questions for ED include how well existing ED models perform on different languages, how challenging ED is in other languages, and how well ED knowledge and annotation can be transferred across languages. To answer those questions, it is crucial to obtain multilingual ED datasets that provide consistent event annotation for multiple languages. There exist some multilingual ED datasets; however, they tend to cover a handful of languages and mainly focus on popular ones. Many languages are not covered in existing multilingual ED datasets. In addition, the current datasets are often small and not accessible to the public. To overcome those shortcomings, we introduce a new large-scale multilingual dataset for ED (called MINION) that consistently annotates events for 8 different languages; 5 of them have not been supported by existing multilingual datasets. We also perform extensive experiments and analysis to demonstrate the challenges and transferability of ED across languages in MINION that in all call for more research effort in this area.","No"
"Align, Write, Re-order: Explainable End-to-End Speech Translation via Operation Sequence Generation","Motoi Omachi, Brian Yan, Siddharth Dalmia, Yuya Fujita, Shinji Watanabe",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05967","The black-box nature of end-to-end speech translation (E2E ST) systems makes it difficult to understand how source language inputs are being mapped to the target language. To solve this problem, we would like to simultaneously generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) and ST predictions such that each source language word is explicitly mapped to a target language word. A major challenge arises from the fact that translation is a non-monotonic sequence transduction task due to word ordering differences between languages -- this clashes with the monotonic nature of ASR. Therefore, we propose to generate ST tokens out-of-order while remembering how to re-order them later. We achieve this by predicting a sequence of tuples consisting of a source word, the corresponding target words, and post-editing operations dictating the correct insertion points for the target word. We examine two variants of such operation sequences which enable generation of monotonic transcriptions and non-monotonic translations from the same speech input simultaneously. We apply our approach to offline and real-time streaming models, demonstrating that we can provide explainable translations without sacrificing quality or latency. In fact, the delayed re-ordering ability of our approach improves performance during streaming. As an added benefit, our method performs ASR and ST simultaneously, making it faster than using two separate systems to perform these tasks.","No"

Existing prompt templates are mainly shared among all training samples with the information of task description. However, training samples are quite diverse. The sharing task description is unable to stimulate the unique task-related information in each training sample, especially for tasks with the finite-label space. To exploit the unique task-related information, we imitate the human decision process which aims to find the contrastive attributes between the objective factual and their potential counterfactuals. Thus, we propose the \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{Prompt}-Tuning (CCPrompt) approach for many-class classification, e.g., relation classification, topic classification, and entity typing. Compared with simple classification tasks, these tasks have more complex finite-label spaces and are more rigorous for prompts. First of all, we prune the finite label space to construct fact-counterfactual pairs. Then, we exploit the contrastive attributes by projecting training instances onto every fact-counterfactual pair. We further set up global prototypes corresponding with all contrastive attributes for selecting valid contrastive attributes as additional tokens in the prompt template. Finally, a simple Siamese representation learning is employed to enhance the robustness of the model. We conduct experiments on relation classification, topic classification, and entity typing tasks in both fully supervised setting and few-shot setting. The results indicate that our model outperforms former baselines.","No"

Yu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06014","Information Extraction (IE) aims to extract structured information from heterogeneous sources. IE from natural language texts include sub-tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), and Event Extraction (EE). Most IE systems require comprehensive understandings of sentence structure, implied semantics, and domain knowledge to perform well; thus, IE tasks always need adequate external resources and annotations. However, it takes time and effort to obtain more human annotations. Low-Resource Information Extraction (LRIE) strives to use unsupervised data, reducing the required resources and human annotation. In practice, existing systems either utilize self-training schemes to generate pseudo labels that will cause the gradual drift problem, or leverage consistency regularization methods which inevitably possess confirmation bias. To alleviate confirmation bias due to the lack of feedback loops in existing LRIE learning paradigms, we develop a Gradient Imitation Reinforcement Learning (GIRL) method to encourage pseudo-labeled data to imitate the gradient descent direction on labeled data, which can force pseudo-labeled data to achieve better optimization capabilities similar to labeled data. Based on how well the pseudo-labeled data imitates the instructive gradient descent direction obtained from labeled data, we design a reward to quantify the imitation process and bootstrap the optimization capability of pseudo-labeled data through trial and error. In addition to learning paradigms, GIRL is not limited to specific sub-tasks, and we leverage GIRL to solve all IE sub-tasks (named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction) in low-resource settings (semi-supervised IE and few-shot IE).","No"

"Helping the Weak Makes You Strong: Simple Multi-Task Learning Improves Non-Autoregressive Translators","Xinyou Wang, Zaixiang Zheng, Shujian Huang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06075","Recently, non-autoregressive (NAR) neural machine translation models have received increasing attention due to their efficient parallel decoding. However, the probabilistic framework of NAR models necessitates conditional independence assumption on target sequences, falling short of characterizing human language data. This drawback results in less informative learning signals for NAR models under conventional MLE training, thereby yielding unsatisfactory accuracy compared to their autoregressive (AR) counterparts. In this paper, we propose a simple and model-agnostic multi-task learning framework to provide more informative learning signals. During training stage, we introduce a set of sufficiently weak AR decoders that solely rely on the information provided by NAR decoder to make prediction, forcing the NAR decoder to become stronger or else it will be unable to support its weak AR partners. Experiments on WMT and IWSLT datasets show that our approach can consistently improve accuracy of multiple NAR baselines without adding any additional decoding overhead.","No"

Donald Trump's ''Chinese Virus'' tweet shifted the blame for the spread of the Covid-19 virus to China and the Chinese people, which triggered a new round of anti-China hate both online and offline. This research intends to examine China-related hate speech on Twitter during the two years following the burst of the pandemic (2020 and 2021). Through Twitter's API, in total 2,172,333 tweets hashtagged #china posted during the time were collected. By employing multiple state-of-the-art pretrained language models for hate speech detection, we identify a wide range of hate of various types, resulting in an automatically labeled anti-China hate speech dataset. We identify a hateful rate in #china tweets of 2.5% in 2020 and 1.9% in 2021. This is well above the average rate of online hate speech on Twitter at 0.6% identified in Gao et al., 2017. We further analyzed the longitudinal development of #china tweets and those identified as hateful in 2020 and 2021 through visualizing the daily number and hate rate over the two years. Our keyword analysis of hate speech in #china tweets reveals the most frequently mentioned terms in the hateful #china tweets, which can be used for further social science studies.","No"

Our work stands in contrast to prior probing work, most of which investigates how much information a model's representations contain. This shift in perspective leads us to propose a new principle for probing, the architectural bottleneck principle: In order to estimate how much information a given component could extract, a probe should look exactly like the component. Relying on this principle, we estimate how much syntactic information is available to transformers through our attentional probe, a probe that exactly resembles a transformer's self-attention head. Experimentally, we find that, in three models (BERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa), a sentence's syntax tree is mostly extractable by our probe, suggesting these models have access to syntactic information while composing their contextual representations.

Multimodal Evaluation for Fine-grained Visual Commonsense","Zhecan Wang, Haoxuan You, Yicheng He, Wenhao Li, Kai-Wei Chang and Shih-Fu Chang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05895","Visual commonsense understanding requires Vision Language (VL) models to not only understand image and text but also cross-reference in-between to fully integrate and achieve comprehension of the visual scene described. Recently, various approaches have been developed and have achieved high performance on visual commonsense benchmarks. However, it is unclear whether the models really understand the visual scene and underlying commonsense knowledge due to limited evaluation data resources. To provide an in-depth analysis, we present a Multimodal Evaluation (ME) pipeline to automatically generate question-answer pairs to test models' understanding of the visual scene, text, and related knowledge. We then take a step further to show that training with the ME data boosts the model's performance in standard VCR evaluation. Lastly, our in-depth analysis and comparison reveal interesting findings: (1) semantically low-level information can assist the learning of high-level information but not the opposite; (2) visual information is generally under utilization compared with text.","No"

"SceneFake: An Initial Dataset and Benchmarks for Scene Fake Audio Detection","Jiangyan Yi and Chenglong Wang and Jianhua Tao and Zhengkun Tian and Cunhang Fan and Haoxin Ma and Ruibo Fu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06073","Previous databases have been designed to further the development of fake audio detection. However, fake utterances are mostly generated by altering timbre, prosody, linguistic content or channel noise of original audios. They ignore a fake situation, in which the attacker manipulates an acoustic scene of the original audio with another forgery one. It will pose a major threat to our society if some people misuse the manipulated audio with malicious purpose. Therefore, this motivates us to fill in the gap. This paper designs such a dataset for scene fake audio detection (SceneFake). A manipulated audio in the SceneFake dataset involves only tampering the acoustic scene of an utterance by using speech enhancement technologies. We can not only detect fake utterances on a seen test set but also evaluate the generalization of fake detection models to unseen manipulation attacks. Some benchmark results are described on the SceneFake dataset. Besides, an analysis of fake attacks with different speech enhancement technologies and signal-to-noise ratios are presented on the dataset. The results show that scene manipulated utterances can not be detected reliably by the existing baseline models of ASVspoof 2019. Furthermore, the detection of unseen scene manipulation audio is still challenging.","No"
"Using Developer Discussions to Guide Fixing Bugs in Software","Sheena Panthaplackel, Milos Gligoric, Junyi Jessy Li, Raymond J. Mooney",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06335","Automatically fixing software bugs is a challenging task. While recent work showed that natural language context is useful in guiding bug-fixing models, the approach required prompting developers to provide this context, which was simulated through commit messages written after the bug-fixing code changes were made. We instead propose using bug report discussions, which are available before the task is performed and are also naturally occurring, avoiding the need for any additional information from developers. For this, we augment standard bug-fixing datasets with bug report discussions. Using these newly compiled datasets, we demonstrate that various forms of natural language context derived from such discussions can aid bug-fixing, even leading to improved performance over using commit messages corresponding to the oracle bug-fixing commits.","No"

In this paper, we conduct a thorough and rigorous study on fairness disparities in peer review with the help of large language models (LMs). We collect, assemble, and maintain a comprehensive relational database for the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) conference from 2017 to date by aggregating data from OpenReview, Google Scholar, arXiv, and CSRanking, and extracting high-level features using language models. We postulate and study fairness disparities on multiple protective attributes of interest, including author gender, geography, author, and institutional prestige. We observe that the level of disparity differs and textual features are essential in reducing biases in the predictive modeling. We distill several insights from our analysis on study the peer review process with the help of large LMs. Our database also provides avenues for studying new natural language processing (NLP) methods that facilitate the understanding of the peer review mechanism. We study a concrete example towards automatic machine review systems and provide baseline models for the review generation and scoring tasks such that the database can be used as a benchmark.","No"

The task of predicting emojis however provides a challenge for machine learning as emoji use tends to cluster into the frequently used and the rarely used emojis. Much of the machine learning research on emoji use has focused on high resource languages and has conceptualised the task of predicting emojis around traditional server-side machine learning approaches. However, traditional machine learning approaches for private communication can introduce privacy concerns, as these approaches require all data to be transmitted to a central storage. In this paper, we seek to address the dual concerns of emphasising high resource languages for emoji prediction and risking the privacy of people's data. We introduce a new dataset of $118$k tweets (augmented from $25$k unique tweets) for emoji prediction in Hindi, and propose a modification to the federated learning algorithm, CausalFedGSD, which aims to strike a balance between model performance and user privacy. We show that our approach obtains comparative scores with more complex centralised models while reducing the amount of data required to optimise the models and minimising risks to user privacy.","No"
"CoNAL: Anticipating Outliers with Large Language Models","Albert Xu, Xiang Ren, and Robin Jia",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15718","In many task settings, text classification models are likely to encounter examples from novel classes on which they cannot predict correctly. Selective prediction, in which models abstain on low-confidence examples, provides a possible solution, but existing models are often overly confident on OOD examples. To remedy this overconfidence, we introduce Contrastive Novelty-Augmented Learning (CoNAL), a two-step method that generates OOD examples representative of novel classes, then trains to decrease confidence on them. First, we generate OOD examples by prompting a large language model twice: we prompt it to enumerate relevant novel labels, then generate examples from each novel class matching the task format. Second, we train our classifier with a novel contrastive objective that encourages lower confidence on generated OOD examples than training examples. When trained with CoNAL, classifiers improve in their ability to detect and abstain on OOD examples over prior methods by an average of 2.3% AUAC and 5.5% AUROC across 4 NLP datasets, with no cost to in-distribution accuracy.","No"

While numerous neural EA models have been devised, they are mainly learned using labelled data only. In this work, we argue that different entities within one KG should have compatible counterparts in the other KG due to the potential dependencies among the entities. Making compatible predictions thus should be one of the goals of training an EA model along with fitting the labelled data: this aspect however is neglected in current methods. To power neural EA models with compatibility, we devise a training framework by addressing three problems: (1) how to measure the compatibility of an EA model; (2) how to inject the property of being compatible into an EA model; (3) how to optimise parameters of the compatibility model. Extensive experiments on widely-used datasets demonstrate the advantages of integrating compatibility within EA models. In fact, state-of-the-art neural EA models trained within our framework using just 5\% of the labelled data can achieve comparable effectiveness with supervised training using 20\% of the labelled data.","No"

However, real-world KGs do not remain static, but rather evolve and grow in tandem with the development of KG applications. Consequently, new facts and previously unseen entities and relations continually emerge, necessitating an embedding model that can quickly learn and transfer new knowledge through growth. Motivated by this, we delve into an expanding field of KG embedding in this paper, i.e., lifelong KG embedding. We consider knowledge transfer and retention of the learning on growing snapshots of a KG without having to learn embeddings from scratch. The proposed model includes a masked KG autoencoder for embedding learning and update, with an embedding transfer strategy to inject the learned knowledge into the new entity and relation embeddings, and an embedding regularization method to avoid catastrophic forgetting. To investigate the impacts of different aspects of KG growth, we construct four datasets to evaluate the performance of lifelong KG embedding. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art inductive and lifelong embedding baselines.","No"

On two datasets, an aspect-oriented summarization dataset of hotel reviews and a generic summarization dataset of Amazon and Yelp reviews, we show that the GPT-3 models achieve very strong performance in human evaluation. We argue that standard evaluation metrics do not reflect this, and evaluate against several new measures targeting faithfulness, factuality, and genericity to contrast these different methods.","No"

In this paper, we present a case study of building text analysis applications that perform multiple classification tasks efficiently in 12 languages in the nascent business area of experience management. In order to scale up modern ML methods on experience data, we leverage cross lingual and multi-task modeling techniques to consolidate our models into a single deployment to avoid overhead.

In this paper, we add new subwords to the SentencePiece tokenizer to apply a multilingual pretrained model to new languages (Inuktitut in this paper).

However, ML researchers who develop advanced methods rarely provide detailed tutorials showing how to apply these methods. Existing tutorials are often costly to participants, presume extensive programming knowledge, and are not tailored to specific application fields. In an attempt to democratize ML methods, we organized a year-long, free, online tutorial series targeted at teaching advanced natural language processing (NLP) methods to computational social science (CSS) scholars. Two organizers worked with fifteen subject matter experts to develop one-hour presentations with hands-on Python code for a range of ML methods and use cases, from data pre-processing to analyzing temporal variation of language change. Although live participation was more limited than expected, a comparison of pre- and post-tutorial surveys showed an increase in participants' perceived knowledge of almost one point on a 7-point Likert scale. Furthermore, participants asked thoughtful questions during tutorials and engaged readily with tutorial content afterwards, as demonstrated by 10K~total views of posted tutorial recordings. In this report, we summarize our organizational efforts and distill five principles for democratizing ML+X tutorials. We hope future organizers improve upon these principles and continue to lower barriers to developing ML skills for researchers of all fields.","No"

For this purpose, we first introduce GLOBE, a large-scale human-annotated multi-domain OpenIE benchmark, to examine the robustness of recent OpenIE models to domain shifts, and the relative performance degradation of up to 70% implies the challenges of generalized OpenIE. Then, we propose DragonIE, which explores a minimalist graph expression of textual fact: directed acyclic graph, to improve the OpenIE generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DragonIE beats the previous methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings by as much as 6.0% in F1 score absolutely, but there is still ample room for improvement.","No"

In this work, we investigate not simply giving common sense, as can be seen in prior research, but also its effective usage. We assume that a part of the environment states different from common sense should constitute one of the grounds for action selection. We propose a novel agent, DiffG-RL, which constructs a Difference Graph that organizes the environment states and common sense by means of interactive objects with a dedicated graph encoder. DiffG-RL also contains a framework for extracting the appropriate amount and representation of common sense from the source to support the construction of the graph.

"Syntactic Substitutability as Unsupervised Dependency Syntax","Jasper Jian and Siva Reddy",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16031","Syntax is a latent hierarchical structure which underpins the robust and compositional nature of human language. An active line of inquiry is whether large pretrained language models (LLMs) are able to acquire syntax by training on text alone; understanding a model's syntactic capabilities is essential to understanding how it processes and makes use of language. In this paper, we propose a new method, SSUD, which allows for the induction of syntactic structures without supervision from gold-standard parses. Instead, we seek to define formalism-agnostic, model-intrinsic syntactic parses by using a property of syntactic relations: syntactic substitutability. We demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative gains on dependency parsing tasks using SSUD, and induce syntactic structures which we hope provide clarity into LLMs and linguistic representations, alike.","No"
"Penalizing Confident Predictions on Largely Perturbed Inputs Does Not Improve Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Question Answering","Kazutoshi Shinoda, Saku Sugawara, Akiko Aizawa",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16093","Question answering (QA) models are shown to be insensitive to large perturbations to inputs; that is, they make correct and confident predictions even when given largely perturbed inputs from which humans can not correctly derive answers. In addition, QA models fail to generalize to other domains and adversarial test sets, while humans maintain high accuracy. Based on these observations, we assume that QA models do not use intended features necessary for human reading but rely on spurious features, causing the lack of generalization ability. Therefore, we attempt to answer the question: If the overconfident predictions of QA models for various types of perturbations are penalized, will the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization be improved? To prevent models from making confident predictions on perturbed inputs, we first follow existing studies and maximize the entropy of the output probability for perturbed inputs. However, we find that QA models trained to be sensitive to a certain perturbation type are often insensitive to unseen types of perturbations. Thus, we simultaneously maximize the entropy for the four perturbation types (i.e., word- and sentence-level shuffling and deletion) to further close the gap between models and humans. Contrary to our expectations, although models become sensitive to the four types of perturbations, we find that the OOD generalization is not improved. Moreover, the OOD generalization is sometimes degraded after entropy maximization. Making unconfident predictions on largely perturbed inputs per se may be beneficial to gaining human trust. However, our negative results suggest that researchers should pay attention to the side effect of entropy maximization.","No"
"Dependency-aware Self-training for Entity Alignment","Bing Liu, Tiancheng Lan, Wen Hua, Guido Zuccon",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16101","Entity Alignment (EA), which aims to detect entity mappings (i.e. equivalent entity pairs) in different Knowledge Graphs (KGs), is critical for KG fusion. Neural EA methods dominate current EA research but still suffer from their reliance on labelled mappings. To solve this problem, a few works have explored boosting the training of EA models with self-training, which adds confidently predicted mappings into the training data iteratively. Though the effectiveness of self-training can be glimpsed in some specific settings, we still have very limited knowledge about it. One reason is the existing works concentrate on devising EA models and only treat self-training as an auxiliary tool. To fill this knowledge gap, we change the perspective to self-training to shed light on it. In addition, the existing self-training strategies have limited impact because they introduce either much False Positive noise or a low quantity of True Positive pseudo mappings. To improve self-training for EA, we propose exploiting the dependencies between entities, a particularity of EA, to suppress the noise without hurting the recall of True Positive mappings. Through extensive experiments, we show that the introduction of dependency makes the self-training strategy for EA reach a new level. The value of self-training in alleviating the reliance on annotation is actually much higher than what has been realised. Furthermore, we suggest future study on smart data annotation to break the ceiling of EA performance.","No"

"Which Shortcut Solution Do Question Answering Models Prefer to Learn?","Kazutoshi Shinoda, Saku Sugawara, Akiko Aizawa",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16220","Question answering (QA) models for reading comprehension tend to learn shortcut solutions rather than the solutions intended by QA datasets. QA models that have learned shortcut solutions can achieve human-level performance in shortcut examples where shortcuts are valid, but these same behaviors degrade generalization potential on anti-shortcut examples where shortcuts are invalid. Various methods have been proposed to mitigate this problem, but they do not fully take the characteristics of shortcuts themselves into account. We assume that the learnability of shortcuts, i.e., how easy it is to learn a shortcut, is useful to mitigate the problem. Thus, we first examine the learnability of the representative shortcuts on extractive and multiple-choice QA datasets. Behavioral tests using biased training sets reveal that shortcuts that exploit answer positions and word-label correlations are preferentially learned for extractive and multiple-choice QA, respectively. We find that the more learnable a shortcut is, the flatter and deeper the loss landscape is around the shortcut solution in the parameter space. We also find that the availability of the preferred shortcuts tends to make the task easier to perform from an information-theoretic viewpoint. Lastly, we experimentally show that the learnability of shortcuts can be utilized to construct an effective QA training set; the more learnable a shortcut is, the smaller the proportion of anti-shortcut examples required to achieve comparable performance on shortcut and anti-shortcut examples. We claim that the learnability of shortcuts should be considered when designing mitigation methods.","No"

In this work, we analyze the time and space complexity of a typical transducer training setup. We propose a memory-efficient training method that computes the transducer loss and gradients sample by sample. We present optimizations to increase the efficiency and parallelism of the sample-wise method. In a set of thorough benchmarks, we show that our sample-wise method significantly reduces memory usage, and performs at competitive speed when compared to the default batched computation. As a highlight, we manage to compute the transducer loss and gradients for a batch size of 1024, and audio length of 40 seconds, using only 6 GB of memory.","No"
"Evaluating Unsupervised Text Classification: Zero-shot and Similarity-based Approaches","Tim Schopf, Daniel Braun, Florian Matthes",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16285","Text classification of unseen classes is a challenging Natural Language Processing task and is mainly attempted using two different types of approaches. Similarity-based approaches attempt to classify instances based on similarities between text document representations and class description representations. Zero-shot text classification approaches aim to generalize knowledge gained from a training task by assigning appropriate labels of unknown classes to text documents. Although existing studies have already investigated individual approaches to these categories, the experiments in literature do not provide a consistent comparison. This paper addresses this gap by conducting a systematic evaluation of different similarity-based and zero-shot approaches for text classification of unseen classes. Different state-of-the-art approaches are benchmarked on four text classification datasets, including a new dataset from the medical domain. Additionally, novel SimCSE and SBERT-based baselines are proposed, as other baselines used in existing work yield weak classification results and are easily outperformed. Finally, the novel similarity-based Lbl2TransformerVec approach is presented, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised text classification. Our experiments show that similarity-based approaches significantly outperform zero-shot approaches in most cases. Additionally, using SimCSE or SBERT embeddings instead of simpler text representations increases similarity-based classification results even further.","No"
"Chaining Simultaneous Thoughts for Numerical Reasoning","Zhihong Shao, Fei Huang, Minlie Huang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16482","Given that rich information is hidden behind ubiquitous numbers in text, numerical reasoning over text should be an essential skill of AI systems. To derive precise equations to solve numerical reasoning problems, previous work focused on modeling the structures of equations, and has proposed various structured decoders. Though structure modeling proves to be effective, these structured decoders construct a single equation in a pre-defined autoregressive order, potentially placing an unnecessary restriction on how a model should grasp the reasoning process. Intuitively, humans may have numerous pieces of thoughts popping up in no pre-defined order; thoughts are not limited to the problem at hand, and can even be concerned with other related problems. By comparing diverse thoughts and chaining relevant pieces, humans are less prone to errors. In this paper, we take this inspiration and propose CANTOR, a numerical reasoner that models reasoning steps using a directed acyclic graph where we produce diverse reasoning steps simultaneously without pre-defined decoding dependencies, and compare and chain relevant ones to reach a solution. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of CANTOR under both fully-supervised and weakly-supervised settings.","No"

We use this resource to evaluate the abstract visual reasoning capacities of recent multi-modal models. We observe that pre-trained weights demonstrate limited abstract reasoning, which dramatically improves with fine-tuning.

We evaluate how well multilingual models can identify politeness levels -- they show a fairly robust zero-shot transfer ability, yet fall short of estimated human accuracy significantly. We further study mapping the English politeness strategy lexicon into nine languages via automatic translation and lexicon induction, analyzing whether each strategy's impact stays consistent across languages. Lastly, we empirically study the complicated relationship between formality and politeness through transfer experiments. We hope our dataset will support various research questions and applications, from evaluating multilingual models to constructing polite multilingual agents.","No"

Model extraction attack (MEA) often refers to an adversary stealing the functionality of the victim model with only query access. In this work, we study the MEA problem against SSL speech model with a small number of queries. We propose a two-stage framework to extract the model. In the first stage, SSL is conducted on the large-scale unlabeled corpus to pre-train a small speech model. Secondly, we actively sample a small portion of clips from the unlabeled corpus and query the target model with these clips to acquire their representations as labels for the small model's second-stage training. Experiment results show that our sampling methods can effectively extract the target model without knowing any information about its model architecture.","No"
"Evaluating and reducing the distance between synthetic and real speech distributions","Christoph Minixhofer, Ond\v{r}ej Klejch, Peter Bell",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16049","While modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems can produce speech rated highly in terms of subjective evaluation, the distance between real and synthetic speech distributions remains understudied, where we use the term \textit{distribution} to mean the sample space of all possible real speech recordings from a given set of speakers; or of the synthetic samples that could be generated for the same set of speakers. We evaluate the distance of real and synthetic speech distributions along the dimensions of the acoustic environment, speaker characteristics and prosody using a range of speech processing measures and the respective Wasserstein distances of their distributions. We reduce these distribution distances along said dimensions by providing utterance-level information derived from the measures to the model and show they can be generated at inference time. The improvements to the dimensions translate to overall distribution distance reduction approximated using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by evaluating the fitness of the synthetic data as training data.","No"

CLIP demonstrates impressive zero-shot classification and retrieval on diverse downstream tasks. However, to leverage its full potential, fine-tuning still appears to be necessary. Fine-tuning the entire CLIP model can be resource-intensive and unstable. Moreover, recent methods that aim to circumvent this need for fine-tuning still require access to images from the target distribution. In this paper, we pursue a different approach and explore the regime of training-free 'name-only transfer' in which the only knowledge we possess about the downstream task comprises the names of downstream target categories. We propose a novel method, SuS-X, consisting of two key building blocks -- SuS and TIP-X, that requires neither intensive fine-tuning nor costly labelled data. SuS-X achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot classification results on 19 benchmark datasets. We further show the utility of TIP-X in the training-free few-shot setting, where we again achieve state-of-the-art results over strong training-free baselines.

AutoCAD first leverages a classifier to unsupervisedly identify rationales as spans to be intervened, which disentangles spurious and causal features. Then, AutoCAD performs controllable generation enhanced by unlikelihood training to produce diverse counterfactuals. Extensive evaluations on multiple out-of-domain and challenge benchmarks demonstrate that AutoCAD consistently and significantly boosts the out-of-distribution performance of powerful pre-trained models across different NLU tasks, which is comparable or even better than previous state-of-the-art human-in-the-loop or task-specific CAD methods.

We propose an unsupervised prosodic clustering process which is used to discretize phoneme-level F0 and duration features from a multispeaker speech dataset. These features are fed as an input sequence of prosodic labels to a prosody encoder module which augments an autoregressive attention-based text-to-speech model. We utilize various methods in order to improve prosodic control range and coverage, such as augmentation, F0 normalization, balanced clustering for duration and speaker-independent clustering. The final model enables fine-grained phoneme-level prosody control for all speakers contained in the training set, while maintaining the speaker identity. Instead of relying on reference utterances for inference, we introduce a prior prosody encoder which learns the style of each speaker and enables speech synthesis without the requirement of reference audio. We also fine-tune the multispeaker model to unseen speakers with limited amounts of data, as a realistic application scenario and show that the prosody control capabilities are maintained, verifying that the speaker-independent prosodic clustering is effective. Experimental results show that the model has high output speech quality and that the proposed method allows efficient prosody control within each speaker's range despite the variability that a multispeaker setting introduces.","No"

We validate the guidelines using 4-way inter-annotator agreement. We evaluate a large number of metrics in terms of correlation with human judgments. The metrics we consider vary in terms of representation (orthographic, phonological, semantic), directness (intrinsic vs extrinsic), granularity (e.g. word, character), and similarity computation method.

We perform an extensive study across six datasets with eight models from three model families. Experimental results show that Coder-Reviewer reranking leads to consistent and significant improvement (up to 17% absolute accuracy gain) over reranking with the Coder model only. When combined with executability filtering, Coder-Reviewer reranking can often outperform the minimum Bayes risk method. Coder-Reviewer reranking is easy to implement by prompting, can generalize to different programming languages, and works well with off-the-shelf hyperparameters.","No"

The main issues that need tackling to develop a joint model for zero and non-zero mentions are the difference between the two types of arguments (zero pronouns, being null, provide no nominal information) and the lack of annotated datasets of a suitable size in which both types of arguments are annotated for languages other than Chinese and Japanese. In this paper, we introduce two architectures for jointly resolving AZPs and non-AZPs, and evaluate them on Arabic, a language for which, as far as we know, there has been no prior work on joint resolution.

We validate and demonstrate these axes on two people-centric datasets: occupations from Wikipedia, and multi-platform discussions in extremist, men's communities over fourteen years. In both studies, contextualized semantic axes can characterize differences among instances of the same word type. In the latter study, we show that references to women and the contexts around them have become more detestable over time.","No"

Langlotz",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12186","Neural image-to-text radiology report generation systems offer the potential to improve radiology reporting by reducing the repetitive process of report drafting and identifying possible medical errors. These systems have achieved promising performance as measured by widely used NLG metrics such as BLEU and CIDEr. However, the current systems face important limitations. First, they present an increased complexity in architecture that offers only marginal improvements on NLG metrics. Secondly, these systems that achieve high performance on these metrics are not always factually complete or consistent due to both inadequate training and evaluation. Recent studies have shown the systems can be substantially improved by using new methods encouraging 1) the generation of domain entities consistent with the reference and 2) describing these entities in inferentially consistent ways. So far, these methods rely on weakly-supervised approaches (rule-based) and named entity recognition systems that are not specific to the chest X-ray domain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new method, the RadGraph reward, to further improve the factual completeness and correctness of generated radiology reports. More precisely, we leverage the RadGraph dataset containing annotated chest X-ray reports with entities and relations between entities. On two open radiology report datasets, our system substantially improves the scores up to 14.2% and 25.3% on metrics evaluating the factual correctness and completeness of reports.","No"
"Syntactic Surprisal From Neural Models Predicts, But Underestimates, Human Processing Difficulty From Syntactic Ambiguities","Suhas Arehalli, Brian Dillon, Tal Linzen",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12187","Humans exhibit garden path effects: When reading sentences that are temporarily structurally ambiguous, they slow down when the structure is disambiguated in favor of the less preferred alternative. Surprisal theory (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008), a prominent explanation of this finding, proposes that these slowdowns are due to the unpredictability of each of the words that occur in these sentences. Challenging this hypothesis, van Schijndel & Linzen (2021) find that estimates of the cost of word predictability derived from language models severely underestimate the magnitude of human garden path effects. In this work, we consider whether this underestimation is due to the fact that humans weight syntactic factors in their predictions more highly than language models do. We propose a method for estimating syntactic predictability from a language model, allowing us to weigh the cost of lexical and syntactic predictability independently. We find that treating syntactic predictability independently from lexical predictability indeed results in larger estimates of garden path. At the same time, even when syntactic predictability is independently weighted, surprisal still greatly underestimate the magnitude of human garden path effects. Our results support the hypothesis that predictability is not the only factor responsible for the processing cost associated with garden path sentences.","No"

Much research has suggested that analogies are key to non-brittle systems that can adapt to new domains. Despite their importance, analogies received little attention in the NLP community, with most research focusing on simple word analogies. Work that tackled more complex analogies relied heavily on manually constructed, hard-to-scale input representations. In this work, we explore a more realistic, challenging setup: our input is a pair of natural language procedural texts, describing a situation or a process (e.g., how the heart works/how a pump works). Our goal is to automatically extract entities and their relations from the text and find a mapping between the different domains based on relational similarity (e.g., blood is mapped to water). We develop an interpretable, scalable algorithm and demonstrate that it identifies the correct mappings 87% of the time for procedural texts and 94% for stories from cognitive-psychology literature. We show it can extract analogies from a large dataset of procedural texts, achieving 79% precision (analogy prevalence in data: 3%).

It relies on introducing noise that ablates information encoded in embeddings, grounded in random baselines and confidence intervals. We apply the method to well-established probing tasks and find evidence that confirms the existence of separate information containers in English GloVe and BERT embeddings.

Characterizing geo-entities is integral to various application domains, such as geo-intelligence and map comprehension, while a key challenge is to capture the spatial-varying context of an entity. We hypothesize that we shall know the characteristics of a geo-entity by its surrounding entities, similar to knowing word meanings by their linguistic context. Accordingly, we propose a novel spatial language model, SpaBERT, which provides a general-purpose geo-entity representation based on neighboring entities in geospatial data. SpaBERT extends BERT to capture linearized spatial context, while incorporating a spatial coordinate embedding mechanism to preserve spatial relations of entities in the 2-dimensional space. SpaBERT is pretrained with masked language modeling and masked entity prediction tasks to learn spatial dependencies. We apply SpaBERT to two downstream tasks: geo-entity typing and geo-entity linking. Compared with the existing language models that do not use spatial context, SpaBERT shows significant performance improvement on both tasks. We also analyze the entity representation from SpaBERT in various settings and the effect of spatial coordinate embedding.","No"

While there has been much work in evaluating these models for their performance on a variety of tasks and languages, little attention has been paid on how well calibrated these models are with respect to the confidence in their predictions. We first investigate the calibration of MMLMs in the zero-shot setting and observe a clear case of miscalibration in low-resource languages or those which are typologically diverse from English. Next, we empirically show that calibration methods like temperature scaling and label smoothing do reasonably well towards improving calibration in the zero-shot scenario. We also find that few-shot examples in the language can further help reduce the calibration errors, often substantially. Overall, our work contributes towards building more reliable multilingual models by highlighting the issue of their miscalibration, understanding what language and model specific factors influence it, and pointing out the strategies to improve the same.","No"

This paper documents the challenges that Perso-Arabic presents beyond the best-documented languages, such as Arabic and Persian, building on earlier work by the expert community. We particularly focus on the situation in natural language processing (NLP), which is affected by multiple, often neglected, issues such as the use of visually ambiguous yet canonically nonequivalent letters and the mixing of letters from different orthographies. Among the contributing conflating factors are the lack of input methods, the instability of modern orthographies, insufficient literacy, and loss or lack of orthographic tradition. We evaluate the effects of script normalization on eight languages from diverse language families in the Perso-Arabic script diaspora on machine translation and statistical language modeling tasks. Our results indicate statistically significant improvements in performance in most conditions for all the languages considered when normalization is applied. We argue that better understanding and representation of Perso-Arabic script variation within regional orthographic traditions, where those are present, is crucial for further progress of modern computational NLP techniques especially for languages with a paucity of resources.","No"

In this work, we reformulate text editing as an imitation game using behavioral cloning. Specifically, we convert conventional sequence-to-sequence data into state-to-action demonstrations, where the action space can be as flexible as needed. Instead of generating the actions one at a time, we introduce a dual decoders structure to parallel the decoding while retaining the dependencies between action tokens, coupled with trajectory augmentation to alleviate the distribution shift that imitation learning often suffers. In experiments on a suite of Arithmetic Equation benchmarks, our model consistently outperforms the autoregressive baselines in terms of performance, efficiency, and robustness. We hope our findings will shed light on future studies in reinforcement learning applying sequence-level action generation to natural language processing.","No"
"What do Large Language Models Learn beyond Language?","Avinash Madasu, Shashank Srivastava",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12302","Large language models (LMs) have rapidly become a mainstay in Natural Language Processing. These models are known to acquire rich linguistic knowledge from training on large amounts of text. In this paper, we investigate if pre-training on text also confers these models with helpful `inductive biases' for non-linguistic reasoning. On a set of 19 diverse non-linguistic tasks involving quantitative computations, recognizing regular expressions and reasoning over strings. We find that pretrained models significantly outperform comparable non-pretrained neural models. This remains true also in experiments with training non-pretrained models with fewer parameters to account for model regularization effects. We further explore the effect of text domain on LMs by pretraining models from text from different domains and provenances. Our experiments surprisingly reveal that the positive effects of pre-training persist even when pretraining on multi-lingual text or computer code, and even for text generated from synthetic languages. Our findings suggest a hitherto unexplored deep connection between pre-training and inductive learning abilities of language models.","No"

We address that question by measuring the correlation between human judgments and neural network probabilities for unknown word inflections. We test a larger range of architectures than previously studied on two important tasks for the cognitive processing debate: English past tense, and German number inflection. We find evidence that the Transformer may be a better account of human behavior than LSTMs on these datasets, and that LSTM features known to increase inflection accuracy do not always result in more human-like behavior.","No"

Current datasets and baselines largely follow sentence-level settings, but fail to address the issues raised by longer documents. In this paper, we establish a general solution, named Retrieval, Reading and Fusion (R2F) framework, and a new setting, by analyzing the main challenges of DOCNLI: interpretability, long-range dependency, and cross-sentence inference. The basic idea of the framework is to simplify document-level task into a set of sentence-level tasks, and improve both performance and interpretability with the power of evidence. For each hypothesis sentence, the framework retrieves evidence sentences from the premise, and reads to estimate its credibility. Then the sentence-level results are fused to judge the relationship between the documents. For the setting, we contribute complementary evidence and entailment label annotation on hypothesis sentences, for interpretability study. Our experimental results show that R2F framework can obtain state-of-the-art performance and is robust for diverse evidence retrieval methods. Moreover, it can give more interpretable prediction results. Our model and code are released at https://github.com/phoenixsecularbird/R2F.","No"

The final task-specific model often achieves compatible or even better performance than PLMs under the zero-shot setting, with orders of magnitude fewer parameters. However, synthetic datasets have their drawbacks. They have long been suffering from low-quality issues (e.g., low informativeness and redundancy). This explains why the massive synthetic data does not lead to better performance -- a scenario we would expect in the human-labeled data. To improve the quality of dataset synthesis, we propose a progressive zero-shot dataset generation framework, ProGen, which leverages the feedback from the task-specific model to guide the generation of new training data via in-context examples. Extensive experiments on five text classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We also show ProGen achieves on-par or superior performance with only 1\% synthetic dataset size compared to baseline methods without in-context feedback.","No"

Recent literature adds extractive summaries as guidance for abstractive summarization models to provide hints of salient content and achieves better performance. However, extractive summaries as guidance could be over strict, leading to information loss or noisy signals. Furthermore, it cannot easily adapt to documents with various abstractiveness. As the number and allocation of salience content pieces vary, it is hard to find a fixed threshold deciding which content should be included in the guidance. In this paper, we propose a novel summarization approach with a flexible and reliable salience guidance, namely SEASON (SaliencE Allocation as Guidance for Abstractive SummarizatiON). SEASON utilizes the allocation of salience expectation to guide abstractive summarization and adapts well to articles in different abstractiveness. Automatic and human evaluations on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed method is effective and reliable. Empirical results on more than one million news articles demonstrate a natural fifteen-fifty salience split for news article sentences, providing a useful insight for composing news articles.","No"

"AI-based Arabic Language and Speech Tutor","Sicong Shao, Saleem Alharir, Salim Hariri, Pratik Satam, Sonia Shiri, Abdessamad Mbarki",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12346","In the past decade, we have observed a growing interest in using technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and chatbots to provide assistance to language learners, especially in second language learning. By using AI and natural language processing (NLP) and chatbots, we can create an intelligent self-learning environment that goes beyond multiple-choice questions and/or fill in the blank exercises. In addition, NLP allows for learning to be adaptive in that it offers more than an indication that an error has occurred. It also provides a description of the error, uses linguistic analysis to isolate the source of the error, and then suggests additional drills to achieve optimal individualized learning outcomes. In this paper, we present our approach for developing an Artificial Intelligence-based Arabic Language and Speech Tutor (AI-ALST) for teaching the Moroccan Arabic dialect. The AI-ALST system is an intelligent tutor that provides analysis and assessment of students learning the Moroccan dialect at University of Arizona (UA). The AI-ALST provides a self-learned environment to practice each lesson for pronunciation training. In this paper, we present our initial experimental evaluation of the AI-ALST that is based on MFCC (Mel frequency cepstrum coefficient) feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), attention mechanism, and a cost-based strategy for dealing with class-imbalance learning.

"Leveraging Large Language Models for Multiple Choice Question Answering","Joshua Robinson, Christopher Michael Rytting, David Wingate",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12353","While large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have achieved impressive results on multiple choice question answering (MCQA) tasks in the zero, one, and few-shot settings, they generally lag behind the MCQA state of the art (SOTA). MCQA tasks have traditionally been presented to LLMs like cloze tasks. An LLM is conditioned on a question (without the associated answer options) and its chosen option is the one assigned the highest probability after normalization (for length, etc.). A more natural prompting approach is to present the question and answer options to the LLM jointly and have it output the symbol (e.g., 'A') associated with its chosen answer option. This approach allows the model to explicitly compare answer options, reduces computational costs, and mitigates the effects of tokenization scheme and answer option representations on answer selection. For the natural approach to be effective the LLM it is used with must be able to associate answer options with the symbols that represent them. The LLM needs what we term multiple choice symbol binding (MCSB) ability. This ability varies greatly by model. We show that a model with high MCSB ability performs much better with the natural approach than with the traditional approach across 20 diverse datasets and largely closes the gap with the SOTA, suggesting that the MCQA ability of LLMs has been previously underestimated.","No"
"Information-Transport-based Policy for Simultaneous Translation","Shaolei Zhang, Yang Feng",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12357","Simultaneous translation (ST) outputs translation while receiving the source inputs, and hence requires a policy to determine whether to translate a target token or wait for the next source token. The major challenge of ST is that each target token can only be translated based on the current received source tokens, where the received source information will directly affect the translation quality. So naturally, how much source information is received for the translation of the current target token is supposed to be the pivotal evidence for the ST policy to decide between translating and waiting. In this paper, we treat the translation as information transport from source to target and accordingly propose an Information-Transport-based Simultaneous Translation (ITST). ITST quantifies the transported information weight from each source token to the current target token, and then decides whether to translate the target token according to its accumulated received information. Experiments on both text-to-text ST and speech-to-text ST (a.k.a., streaming speech translation) tasks show that ITST outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance.","No"

The results show that prompt tuning achieves much better cross-lingual transfer than fine-tuning across datasets, with only 0.1% to 0.3% tuned parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate through the analysis that prompt tuning can have better cross-lingual transferability of representations on downstream tasks with better aligned decision boundaries.","No"

Such noise can hurt model training and ultimately lead to poor generalization performance. A general framework named ASSIST has recently been proposed to train robust dialogue state tracking (DST) models. It introduces an auxiliary model to generate pseudo labels for the noisy training set. These pseudo labels are combined with vanilla labels by a common fixed weighting parameter to train the primary DST model. Notwithstanding the improvements of ASSIST on DST, tuning the weighting parameter is challenging. Moreover, a single parameter shared by all slots and all instances may be suboptimal. To overcome these limitations, we propose a meta learning-based framework MetaASSIST to adaptively learn the weighting parameter. Specifically, we propose three schemes with varying degrees of flexibility, ranging from slot-wise to both slot-wise and instance-wise, to convert the weighting parameter into learnable functions. These functions are trained in a meta-learning manner by taking the validation set as meta data. Experimental results demonstrate that all three schemes can achieve competitive performance.

However, a number of redundant parameters which contribute less to the downstream task are observed in a directly fine-tuned model. We consider the gap between pretraining and downstream tasks hinders the training of these redundant parameters, and results in a suboptimal performance of the overall model. In this paper, we present PATS (Perturbation According To Sensitivity), a noisy training mechanism which considers each parameter's importance in the downstream task to help fine-tune PLMs. The main idea of PATS is to add bigger noise to parameters with lower sensitivity and vice versa, in order to activate more parameters' contributions to downstream tasks without affecting the sensitive ones much. Extensive experiments conducted on different tasks of the GLUE benchmark show PATS can consistently empower the fine-tuning of different sizes of PLMs, and the parameters in the well-performing models always have more concentrated distributions of sensitivities, which experimentally proves the effectiveness of our method.","No"
"Recurrence Boosts Diversity! Revisiting Recurrent Latent Variable in Transformer-Based Variational AutoEncoder for Diverse Text Generation","Jinyi Hu, Xiaoyuan Yi, Wenhao Li, Maosong Sun, Xing Xie",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12409","Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) has been widely adopted in text generation. Among many variants, recurrent VAE learns token-wise latent variables with each conditioned on the preceding ones, which captures sequential variability better in the era of RNN. However, it is unclear how to incorporate such recurrent dynamics into the recently dominant Transformer due to its parallelism. In this work, we propose DELLA, a Transformer-based recurrent VAE structure. DELLA imposes recurrence on segment-wise latent variables with arbitrarily separated text segments and constructs the posterior distribution with residual parameterization. Besides, we design an acceleration method by approximating idempotent matrices, which allows parallelism while maintaining the conditional dependence of latent variables. We demonstrate that DELLA could enhance the entanglement of each segment and preceding latent variables and deduce a non-zero lower bound of the KL term, providing a theoretical guarantee of generation diversity. Experiments on two unconditional and one conditional generation tasks show that DELLA achieves significantly improved diversity while maintaining satisfactory generation quality.","No"

"Hard Gate Knowledge Distillation -- Leverage Calibration for Robust and Reliable Language Model","Dongkyu Lee, Zhiliang Tian, Yingxiu Zhao, Ka Chun Cheung, Nevin L. Zhang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12427","In knowledge distillation, a student model is trained with supervisions from both knowledge from a teacher and observations drawn from a training data distribution. Knowledge of a teacher is considered a subject that holds inter-class relations which send a meaningful supervision to a student; hence, much effort has been put to find such knowledge to be distilled. In this paper, we explore a question that has been given little attention: 'when to distill such knowledge.' The question is answered in our work with the concept of model calibration; we view a teacher model not only as a source of knowledge but also as a gauge to detect miscalibration of a student. This simple and yet novel view leads to a hard gate knowledge distillation scheme that switches between learning from a teacher model and training data. We verify the gating mechanism in the context of natural language generation at both the token-level and the sentence-level. Empirical comparisons with strong baselines show that hard gate knowledge distillation not only improves model generalization, but also significantly lowers model calibration error.","No"
"Robots-Dont-Cry: Understanding Falsely Anthropomorphic Utterances in Dialog Systems","David Gros, Yu Li, Zhou Yu",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12429","Dialog systems are often designed or trained to output human-like responses. However, some responses may be impossible for a machine to truthfully say (e.g. 'that movie made me cry'). Highly anthropomorphic responses might make users uncomfortable or implicitly deceive them into thinking they are interacting with a human. We collect human ratings on the feasibility of approximately 900 two-turn dialogs sampled from 9 diverse data sources. Ratings are for two hypothetical machine embodiments: a futuristic humanoid robot and a digital assistant. We find that for some data-sources commonly used to train dialog systems, 20-30% of utterances are not viewed as possible for a machine. Rating is marginally affected by machine embodiment. We explore qualitative and quantitative reasons for these ratings. Finally, we build classifiers and explore how modeling configuration might affect output permissibly, and discuss implications for building less falsely anthropomorphic dialog systems.","No"
"Structure-Unified M-Tree Coding Solver for MathWord Problem","Bin Wang, Jiangzhou Ju, Yang Fan, Xin-Yu Dai, Shujian Huang, Jiajun Chen",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12432","As one of the challenging NLP tasks, designing math word problem (MWP) solvers has attracted increasing research attention for the past few years. In previous work, models designed by taking into account the properties of the binary tree structure of mathematical expressions at the output side have achieved better performance. However, the expressions corresponding to a MWP are often diverse (e.g., $n_1+n_2 \times n_3-n_4$, $n_3\times n_2-n_4+n_1$, etc.), and so are the corresponding binary trees, which creates difficulties in model learning due to the non-deterministic output space. In this paper, we propose the Structure-Unified M-Tree Coding Solver (SUMC-Solver), which applies a tree with any M branches (M-tree) to unify the output structures. To learn the M-tree, we use a mapping to convert the M-tree into the M-tree codes, where codes store the information of the paths from tree root to leaf nodes and the information of leaf nodes themselves, and then devise a Sequence-to-Code (seq2code) model to generate the codes. Experimental results on the widely used MAWPS and Math23K datasets have demonstrated that SUMC-Solver not only outperforms several state-of-the-art models under similar experimental settings but also performs much better under low-resource conditions.","No"
"Generative Prompt Tuning for Relation Classification","Jiale Han, Shuai Zhao, Bo Cheng, Shengkun Ma, Wei Lu",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12435","Using prompts to explore the knowledge contained within pre-trained language models for downstream tasks has now become an active topic. Current prompt tuning methods mostly convert the downstream tasks to masked language modeling problems by adding cloze-style phrases and mapping all labels to verbalizations with fixed length, which has proven effective for tasks with simple label spaces. However, when applied to relation classification exhibiting complex label spaces, vanilla prompt tuning methods may struggle with label verbalizations with arbitrary lengths due to rigid prompt restrictions. Inspired by the text infilling task for pre-training generative models that can flexibly predict missing spans, we propose a novel generative prompt tuning method to reformulate relation classification as an infilling problem, which frees our approach from limitations of current prompt based approaches and thus fully exploits rich semantics of entity and relation types. In addition, we design entity-guided decoding and discriminative relation scoring to generate and align relations effectively and efficiently during inference. Extensive experiments under fully supervised settings and low-resource settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","No"

To this end, we establish a multi-reference KGC dataset and propose a series of metrics to systematically assess the one-to-many efficacy of existing KGC models.

Although having made remarkable progress in video-grounded dialogue generation, existing methods still fall short when it comes to integrating with PLMs in a way that allows information from different modalities to complement each other. To alleviate these issues, we first propose extracting pertinent information from videos and turning it into reasoning paths that are acceptable to PLMs. Additionally, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning method to collaboratively perform reasoning on different modalities (i.e., video and dialogue context). Empirical experiment results on two public datasets indicate that the proposed model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art models by large margins on both automatic and human evaluations.","No"

Experiments on two benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Thanks to the transferable latent structure, our model is able to yield better dialogue responses than four strong baselines in terms of both automatic and human evaluations, and our model with about 22% parameters particularly delivers a 5x speedup in running time compared with the strongest baseline.

The key challenge for this idea is that off-the-shelf parsers are unreliable when processing ungrammatical sentences. To confront this challenge, we propose to build a tailored GEC-oriented parser (GOPar) using parallel GEC training data as a pivot. First, we design an extended syntax representation scheme that allows us to represent both grammatical errors and syntax in a unified tree structure. Then, we obtain parse trees of the source incorrect sentences by projecting trees of the target correct sentences. Finally, we train GOPar with such projected trees. For GEC, we employ the graph convolution network to encode source-side syntactic information produced by GOPar, and fuse them with the outputs of the Transformer encoder. Experiments on mainstream English and Chinese GEC datasets show that our proposed SynGEC approach consistently and substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves competitive performance.

Current approaches for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks use CL to improve in-distribution data performance often via heuristic-oriented or task-agnostic difficulties. In this work, instead, we employ CL for NLU by taking advantage of training dynamics as difficulty metrics, i.e., statistics that measure the behavior of the model at hand on specific task-data instances during training and propose modifications of existing CL schedulers based on these statistics. Differently from existing works, we focus on evaluating models on in-distribution (ID), out-of-distribution (OOD) as well as zero-shot (ZS) cross-lingual transfer datasets. We show across several NLU tasks that CL with training dynamics can result in better performance mostly on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer and OOD settings with improvements up by 8.5% in certain cases. Overall, experiments indicate that training dynamics can lead to better performing models with smoother training compared to other difficulty metrics while being 20% faster on average. In addition, through analysis we shed light on the correlations of task-specific versus task-agnostic metrics.","No"

This paper takes a novel angle, namely, emotion detection and trigger summarization, aiming to both detect perceived emotions in text, and summarize events and their appraisals that trigger each emotion. To support this goal, we introduce CovidET (Emotions and their Triggers during Covid-19), a dataset of ~1,900 English Reddit posts related to COVID-19, which contains manual annotations of perceived emotions and abstractive summaries of their triggers described in the post. We develop strong baselines to jointly detect emotions and summarize emotion triggers.

Motivated by the natural phenomenon of code-switching (CS) in multilingual speakers, CS has been used as an effective data augmentation method that offers language alignment at word- or phrase-level, in contrast to sentence-level via parallel instances. Existing approaches either use dictionaries or parallel sentences with word-alignment to generate CS data by randomly switching words in a sentence. However, such methods can be suboptimal as dictionaries disregard semantics, and syntax might become invalid after random word switching. In this work, we propose EntityCS, a method that focuses on Entity-level Code-Switching to capture fine-grained cross-lingual semantics without corrupting syntax. We use Wikidata and the English Wikipedia to construct an entity-centric CS corpus by switching entities to their counterparts in other languages. We further propose entity-oriented masking strategies during intermediate model training on the EntityCS corpus for improving entity prediction. Evaluation of the trained models on four entity-centric downstream tasks shows consistent improvements over the baseline with a notable increase of 10% in Fact Retrieval.

However, in this work, we demonstrate that these reference-free metrics are inherently biased and limited in their ability to evaluate generated text, and we argue that they should not be used to measure progress on tasks like machine translation or summarization. We show how reference-free metrics are equivalent to using one generation model to evaluate another, which has several limitations: (1) the metrics can be optimized at test time to find the approximate best-possible output, (2) they are inherently biased toward models which are more similar to their own, and (3) they can be biased against higher-quality outputs, including those written by humans. Therefore, we recommend that reference-free metrics should be used as diagnostic tools for analyzing and understanding model behavior instead of measures of how well models perform a task, in which the goal is to achieve as high of a score as possible.","No"

In this study, we explore the extent to which visual grounding facilitates the acquisition of function words using stable diffusion models that employ multimodal models for text-to-image generation. Out of seven categories of function words, along with numerous subcategories, we find that stable diffusion models effectively model only a small fraction of function words -- a few pronoun subcategories and relatives.

In this work, we observe that models trained with APE over-rely on positional information to the point that they break-down when subjected to sentences with shifted position information. Specifically, when models are subjected to sentences starting from a non-zero position (excluding the effect of priming), they exhibit noticeably degraded performance on zero to full-shot tasks, across a range of model families and model sizes. Our findings raise questions about the efficacy of APEs to model the relativity of position information, and invite further introspection on the sentence and word order processing strategies employed by these models.","No"
"Efficient Nearest Neighbor Search for Cross-Encoder Models using Matrix Factorization","Nishant Yadav, Nicholas Monath, Rico Angell, Manzil Zaheer and Andrew McCallum",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12579","Efficient k-nearest neighbor search is a fundamental task, foundational for many problems in NLP. When the similarity is measured by dot-product between dual-encoder vectors or $\ell_2$-distance, there already exist many scalable and efficient search methods. But not so when similarity is measured by more accurate and expensive black-box neural similarity models, such as cross-encoders, which jointly encode the query and candidate neighbor. The cross-encoders' high computational cost typically limits their use to reranking candidates retrieved by a cheaper model, such as dual encoder or TF-IDF. However, the accuracy of such a two-stage approach is upper-bounded by the recall of the initial candidate set, and potentially requires additional training to align the auxiliary retrieval model with the cross-encoder model. In this paper, we present an approach that avoids the use of a dual-encoder for retrieval, relying solely on the cross-encoder. Retrieval is made efficient with CUR decomposition, a matrix decomposition approach that approximates all pairwise cross-encoder distances from a small subset of rows and columns of the distance matrix. Indexing items using our approach is computationally cheaper than training an auxiliary dual-encoder model through distillation. Empirically, for k > 10, our approach provides test-time recall-vs-computational cost trade-offs superior to the current widely-used methods that re-rank items retrieved using a dual-encoder or TF-IDF.","No"

With large language models and sufficient training data, prompt tuning performs comparably to full-model tuning. However, with limited training samples in few-shot settings, prompt tuning fails to match the performance of full-model fine-tuning. In this work, we focus on improving the few-shot performance of prompt tuning by transferring knowledge from soft prompts of source tasks. Recognizing the good generalization capabilities of ensemble methods in low-data regime, we first experiment and show that a simple ensemble of model predictions based on different source prompts, outperforms existing multi-prompt knowledge transfer approaches such as source prompt fusion in the few-shot setting. Motivated by this observation, we further investigate model ensembles and propose Sample-specific Ensemble of Source Models (SESoM). SESoM learns to adjust the contribution of each source model for each target sample separately when ensembling source model outputs. Through this way, SESoM inherits the superior generalization of model ensemble approaches and simultaneously captures the sample-specific competence of each source prompt. We conduct experiments across a diverse set of eight NLP tasks using models of different scales (T5-{base, large, XL}) and find that SESoM consistently outperforms the existing models of the same as well as larger parametric scale by a large margin.","No"

However, chain of thought prompting has significant limitations due to its dependency on huge pretrained LMs. In this work, we present compositional fine-tuning (CFT): an approach based on explicitly decomposing a target task into component tasks, and then fine-tuning smaller LMs on a curriculum of such component tasks. We apply CFT to recommendation tasks in two domains, world travel and local dining, as well as a previously studied inferential task (sports understanding). We show that CFT outperforms end-to-end learning even with equal amounts of data, and gets consistently better as more component tasks are modeled via fine-tuning. Compared with chain of thought prompting, CFT performs at least as well using LMs only 7.4% of the size, and is moreover applicable to task domains for which data are not available during pretraining.","No"
"Modal-specific Pseudo Query Generation for Video Corpus Moment Retrieval","Minjoon Jung, Seongho Choi, Joochan Kim, Jin-Hwa Kim, Byoung-Tak Zhang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12617","Video corpus moment retrieval (VCMR) is the task to retrieve the most relevant video moment from a large video corpus using a natural language query. For narrative videos, e.g., dramas or movies, the holistic understanding of temporal dynamics and multimodal reasoning is crucial. Previous works have shown promising results; however, they relied on the expensive query annotations for VCMR, i.e., the corresponding moment intervals. To overcome this problem, we propose a self-supervised learning framework: Modal-specific Pseudo Query Generation Network (MPGN). First, MPGN selects candidate temporal moments via subtitle-based moment sampling. Then, it generates pseudo queries exploiting both visual and textual information from the selected temporal moments. Through the multimodal information in the pseudo queries, we show that MPGN successfully learns to localize the video corpus moment without any explicit annotation. We validate the effectiveness of MPGN on the TVR dataset, showing competitive results compared with both supervised models and unsupervised setting models.","No"
"Conformal Predictor for Improving Zero-shot Text Classification Efficiency","Prafulla Kumar Choubey, Yu Bai, Chien-Sheng Wu, Wenhao Liu, Nazneen Rajani",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12619","Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been shown effective for zero-shot (0shot) text classification. 0shot models based on natural language inference (NLI) and next sentence prediction (NSP) employ cross-encoder architecture and infer by making a forward pass through the model for each label-text pair separately. This increases the computational cost to make inferences linearly in the number of labels. In this work, we improve the efficiency of such cross-encoder-based 0shot models by restricting the number of likely labels using another fast base classifier-based conformal predictor (CP) calibrated on samples labeled by the 0shot model. Since a CP generates prediction sets with coverage guarantees, it reduces the number of target labels without excluding the most probable label based on the 0shot model. We experiment with three intent and two topic classification datasets. With a suitable CP for each dataset, we reduce the average inference time for NLI- and NSP-based models by 25.6% and 22.2% respectively, without dropping performance below the predefined error rate of 1%.","No"
"Model and Data Transfer for Cross-Lingual Sequence Labelling in Zero-Resource Settings","Iker Garc\'ia-Ferrero, Rodrigo Agerri, German Rigau",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12623","Zero-resource cross-lingual transfer approaches aim to apply supervised models from a source language to unlabelled target languages. In this paper we perform an in-depth study of the two main techniques employed so far for cross-lingual zero-resource sequence labelling, based either on data or model transfer. Although previous research has proposed translation and annotation projection (data-based cross-lingual transfer) as an effective technique for cross-lingual sequence labelling, in this paper we experimentally demonstrate that high capacity multilingual language models applied in a zero-shot (model-based cross-lingual transfer) setting consistently outperform data-based cross-lingual transfer approaches. A detailed analysis of our results suggests that this might be due to important differences in language use. More specifically, machine translation often generates a textual signal which is different to what the models are exposed to when using gold standard data, which affects both the fine-tuning and evaluation processes. Our results also indicate that data-based cross-lingual transfer approaches remain a competitive option when high-capacity multilingual language models are not available.","No"
"PoKE: Prior Knowledge Enhanced Emotional Support Conversation with Latent Variable","Xiaohan Xu, Xuying Meng, Yequan Wang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12640","Emotional support conversation (ESC) task can utilize various support strategies to help people relieve emotional distress and overcome the problem they face, which have attracted much attention in these years. The emotional support is a critical communication skill that should be trained into dialogue systems. Most existing studies predict support strategy according to current context and provide corresponding emotional support in response. However, these works ignore two significant characteristics of ESC. (a) Abundant prior knowledge exists in historical conversations, such as the responses to similar cases and the general order of support strategies, which has a great reference value for current conversation. (b) There is a one-to-many mapping relationship between context and support strategy, i.e.multiple strategies are reasonable for a single context. It lays a better foundation for the diversity of generations. To take into account these two key factors, we Prior Knowledge Enhanced emotional support conversation with latent variable model, PoKE. The proposed model fully taps the potential of prior knowledge in terms of exemplars and strategy sequence and then utilizes a latent variable to model the one-to-many relationship of support strategy. Furthermore, we introduce a memory schema to effectively incorporate encoded knowledge into decoder. Experiment results on benchmark dataset~(i.e., ESConv) show that our PoKE outperforms existing baselines on both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. Further experiments prove that abundant prior knowledge is conducive to high-quality emotional support, and a well-learned latent variable is critical to the diversity of generations.","No"

Furthermore, they do not have the mechanism to still recover the model's ability to access the target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised non-transferable learning method for the text classification task that does not require annotated target domain data. We further introduce a secret key component in our approach for recovering the access to the target domain, where we design both an explicit and an implicit method for doing so.

SAT first generates two augmented views for each unlabeled data and then trains a meta-learner to automatically identify the relative strength of augmentations based on the similarity between the original view and the augmented views. The weakly-augmented view is fed to the model to produce a pseudo-label and the strongly-augmented view is used to train the model to predict the same pseudo-label.

Based on the dataset, we test the performance of phrase grounding by using a state-of-the-art literature model of this line. Then, we enhance the baseline grounding model with coreference information which should help our task potentially, modeling the coreference structures with graph convolutional networks. Experiments on our dataset, interestingly, show that pronouns are easier to ground than noun phrases, where the possible reason might be that these pronouns are much less ambiguous. Additionally, our final model with coreference information can significantly boost the grounding performance of both noun phrases and pronouns.","No"

Therefore, the benefit that machines can automatically generate content to reduce human efforts on Wikipedia language projects could be considerable. In this paper, we propose our mapping process for the task of converting Wikidata statements to natural language text (WS2T) for Wikipedia projects at the sentence level. The main step is to organize statements, represented as a group of quadruples and triples, and then to map them to corresponding sentences in English Wikipedia. We evaluate the output corpus in various aspects: sentence structure analysis, noise filtering, and relationships between sentence components based on word embedding models. The results are helpful not only for the data-to-text generation task but also for other relevant works in the field.","No"

In practice, text-to-SQL parsers often encounter various challenging scenarios, requiring them to be generalizable and robust. While most existing work addresses a particular generalization or robustness challenge, we aim to study it in a more comprehensive manner. In specific, we believe that text-to-SQL parsers should be (1) generalizable at three levels of generalization, namely i.i.d., zero-shot, and compositional, and (2) robust against input perturbations. To enhance these capabilities of the parser, we propose a novel TKK framework consisting of Task decomposition, Knowledge acquisition, and Knowledge composition to learn text-to-SQL parsing in stages. By dividing the learning process into multiple stages, our framework improves the parser's ability to acquire general SQL knowledge instead of capturing spurious patterns, making it more generalizable and robust.

However, these systems typically retrieve facts from KGs using simple heuristics that disregard the complex challenges of identifying situationally-relevant commonsense knowledge (e.g., contextualization, implicitness, ambiguity). In this work, we propose the new task of commonsense fact linking, where models are given contexts and trained to identify situationally-relevant commonsense knowledge from KGs. Our novel benchmark, ComFact, contains ~293k in-context relevance annotations for commonsense triplets across four stylistically diverse dialogue and storytelling datasets. Experimental results confirm that heuristic fact linking approaches are imprecise knowledge extractors. Learned fact linking models demonstrate across-the-board performance improvements (~34.6% F1) over these heuristics.

In this paper, we argue for quantifying and assessing this expectation. To that end, we propose an automated measure for evaluating the degree to which a summary is ``disperse'', in the sense of the number of source documents needed to cover its content. We apply our measure to empirically analyze several popular MDS datasets, with respect to their reference summaries, as well as the output of state-of-the-art systems. Our results show that certain MDS datasets barely require combining information from multiple documents, where a single document often covers the full summary content.

However, writing an appropriate PI can be extremely time-consuming for physicians, and is subject to being incomplete or error-prone for (potentially overworked) physicians. Therefore, we propose a new task that can provide an objective means of avoiding incompleteness, while reducing clinical workload: the automatic generation of the PI, which is imagined as being a document that the clinician can review, modify, and approve as necessary (rather than taking the human 'out of the loop').

We investigate the possibility of using pre-trained models and out-of-the-box features from available libraries. We employ random sampling to generate diverse alternatives, which reveals good results.

"Automated Essay Scoring using Transformers","Kshitij Gupta",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12809","Despite being investigated for over five decades, the task of automated essay scoring continues to draw a lot of attention in the NLP community, in part because of its commercial and educational values as well as the associated research challenges. Large pre-trained models have made remarkable progress in NLP. Data augmentation techniques have also helped build state-of-the-art models for automated essay scoring. Many works in the past have attempted to solve this problem by using RNNs, LSTMs, etc. This work examines the transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa, etc. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer models and data augmentation for automated essay grading across many topics using a single model.","No"
"Code4Struct: Code Generation for Few-Shot Structured Prediction from Natural Language","Xingyao Wang, Sha Li, Heng Ji",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12810","Large Language Model (LLM) trained on the mixture of text and code has demonstrated impressive capability in translating natural language (NL) into structured code. In this work, we propose Code4Struct to leverage such text-to-structure translation capability to tackle structured prediction tasks in NLP. For example, Event Argument Extraction (EAE) aims to convert text into event-argument structures that can be represented as a class object using code. This alignment between structures and code enables us to take advantage of Programming Language (PL) features such as inheritance and type annotation to introduce external knowledge or add constraints with ease. We exploit the analogy between PL and NLP problems, and, as a case study, we use Code4Struct to tackle the EAE task using code generation. We ask a LLM to generate code to instantiate an event class with predicted arguments given a NL sentence. Despite only using 50 training instances for each event type, Code4Struct is comparable to fully-supervised models trained on 4,202 event instances and, when given the same 50-shot data, outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 20.8% absolute F1. When prompted with hierarchical event types implemented using inheritance, Code4Struct can predict arguments for low-resource event types using 10-shot training instances from its sibling event type and outperforms zero-shot baseline by 12% absolute F1.","No"

To address this line of research, we propose TAPE (Text Attack and Perturbation Evaluation), a novel benchmark that includes six more complex NLU tasks for Russian, covering multi-hop reasoning, ethical concepts, logic and commonsense knowledge. The TAPE's design focuses on systematic zero-shot and few-shot NLU evaluation: (i) linguistic-oriented adversarial attacks and perturbations for analyzing robustness, and (ii) subpopulations for nuanced interpretation. The detailed analysis of testing the autoregressive baselines indicates that simple spelling-based perturbations affect the performance the most, while paraphrasing the input has a more negligible effect. At the same time, the results demonstrate a significant gap between the neural and human baselines for most tasks. We publicly release TAPE (tape-benchmark.com) to foster research on robust LMs that can generalize to new tasks when little to no supervision is available.","No"

To this end, we introduce the Russian Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (RuCoLA), built from the ground up under the well-established binary LA approach. RuCoLA consists of $9.8$k in-domain sentences from linguistic publications and $3.6$k out-of-domain sentences produced by generative models.

"Towards Pragmatic Production Strategies for Natural Language Generation Tasks","Mario Giulianelli",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12828","This position paper proposes a conceptual framework for the design of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems that follow efficient and effective production strategies in order to achieve complex communicative goals. In this general framework, efficiency is characterised as the parsimonious regulation of production and comprehension costs while effectiveness is measured with respect to task-oriented and contextually grounded communicative goals. We provide concrete suggestions for the estimation of goals, costs, and utility via modern statistical methods, demonstrating applications of our framework to the classic pragmatic task of visually grounded referential games and to abstractive text summarisation, two popular generation tasks with real-world applications. In sum, we advocate for the development of NLG systems that learn to make pragmatic production decisions from experience, by reasoning about goals, costs, and utility in a human-like way.","No"

This study tackles the unsupervised learning of semantic representations for spoken utterances. Through converting speech signals into hidden units generated from acoustic unit discovery, we propose WavEmbed, a multimodal sequential autoencoder that predicts hidden units from a dense representation of speech. Secondly, we also propose S-HuBERT to induce meaning through knowledge distillation, in which a sentence embedding model is first trained on hidden units and passes its knowledge to a speech encoder through contrastive learning. The best performing model achieves a moderate correlation (0.5~0.6) with human judgments, without relying on any labels or transcriptions. Furthermore, these models can also be easily extended to leverage textual transcriptions of speech to learn much better speech embeddings that are strongly correlated with human annotations. Our proposed methods are applicable to the development of purely data-driven systems for speech mining, indexing and search.","No"

This allows for synthesizing the information from multiple candidates into a concise, natural-sounding answer. However, creating large-scale supervised training data for GenQA models is very challenging. In this paper, we propose to train a GenQA model by transferring knowledge from a trained AS2 model, to overcome the aforementioned issue. First, we use an AS2 model to produce a ranking over answer candidates for a set of questions. Then, we use the top ranked candidate as the generation target, and the next k top ranked candidates as context for training a GenQA model. We also propose to use the AS2 model prediction scores for loss weighting and score-conditioned input/output shaping, to aid the knowledge transfer. Our evaluation on three public and one large industrial datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach over the AS2 baseline, and GenQA trained using supervised data.","No"

To address event-centric QA, we propose a novel QA model with contrastive learning and invertible event transformation, call TranCLR. Our proposed model utilizes an invertible transformation matrix to project semantic vectors of events into a common event embedding space, trained with contrastive learning, and thus naturally inject event semantic knowledge into mainstream QA pipelines. The transformation matrix is fine-tuned with the annotated event relation types between events that occurred in questions and those in answers, using event-aware question vectors. Experimental results on the Event Semantic Relation Reasoning (ESTER) dataset show significant improvements in both generative and extractive settings compared to the existing strong baselines, achieving over 8.4% gain in the token-level F1 score and 3.0% gain in Exact Match (EM) score under the multi-answer setting.

Common properties of nouns (e.g., red strawberries, small ant) are, however, more challenging to extract compared to other types of knowledge because they are rarely explicitly stated in texts. We hypothesize this to mainly be the case for perceptual properties which are obvious to the participants in the communication. We propose to extract these properties from images and use them in an ensemble model, in order to complement the information that is extracted from language models. We consider perceptual properties to be more concrete than abstract properties (e.g., interesting, flawless). We propose to use the adjectives' concreteness score as a lever to calibrate the contribution of each source (text vs. images). We evaluate our ensemble model in a ranking task where the actual properties of a noun need to be ranked higher than other non-relevant properties. Our results show that the proposed combination of text and images greatly improves noun property prediction compared to powerful text-based language models.","No"

In this study, we demonstrate the significance of domain selection by assessing a state-of-the-art Bangla automatic speech recognition (ASR) model on a novel multi-domain Bangladeshi Bangla ASR evaluation benchmark - BanSpeech, which contains 7.2 hours of speech and 9802 utterances from 19 distinct domains. The ASR model has been trained with deep convolutional neural network (CNN), layer normalization technique, and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss criterion on SUBAK.KO, a mostly read speech corpus for the low-resource and morphologically rich language Bangla. Experimental evaluation reveals the ASR model on SUBAK.KO faces difficulty recognizing speech from domains with mostly spontaneous speech and has a high number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. The same ASR model, on the other hand, performs better in read speech domains and contains fewer OOV words. In addition, we report the outcomes of our experiments with layer normalization, input feature extraction, number of convolutional layers, etc., and set a baseline on SUBAK.KO. The BanSpeech will be publicly available to meet the need for a challenging evaluation benchmark for Bangla ASR.","No"

In this paper, we present a new KBQA model, TIARA, which addresses those issues by applying multi-grained retrieval to help the PLM focus on the most relevant KB contexts, viz., entities, exemplary logical forms, and schema items. Moreover, constrained decoding is used to control the output space and reduce generation errors. Experiments over important benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

However, previous studies of memorization in constrained NLG tasks have only focused on counterfactual memorization, linking it to the problem of hallucinations. In this work, we propose a new, inexpensive algorithm for extractive memorization (exact training data generation under insufficient context) in constrained sequence generation tasks and use it to study extractive memorization and its effects in NMT. We demonstrate that extractive memorization poses a serious threat to NMT reliability by qualitatively and quantitatively characterizing the memorized samples as well as the model behavior in their vicinity. Based on empirical observations, we develop a simple algorithm which elicits non-memorized translations of memorized samples from the same model, for a large fraction of such samples. Finally, we show that the proposed algorithm could also be leveraged to mitigate memorization in the model through finetuning.

Specifically, we constructed an impolite dialogue corpus and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the state-of-the-art TOD systems on our impolite dialogue corpus. Our experimental results show that existing TOD systems are unable to handle impolite user utterances. We also present a data augmentation method to improve TOD performance in impolite dialogues.

A notable advantage of NER is its consistency in extracting biomedical entities in a document context. Although existing document NER models show consistent predictions, they still do not meet our expectations. We investigated whether the adjectives and prepositions within an entity cause a low label consistency, which results in inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we present our method, ConNER, which enhances the label dependency of modifiers (e.g., adjectives and prepositions) to achieve higher label agreement. ConNER refines the draft labels of the modifiers to improve the output representations of biomedical entities. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on four popular biomedical NER datasets; in particular, its efficacy is proved on two datasets with 7.5-8.6% absolute improvements in the F1 score. We interpret that our ConNER method is effective on datasets that have intrinsically low label consistency.

Specifically, we train language models (LMs) with and without these two components with the model sizes carefully controlled, and evaluate their syntactic generalization performance against six test circuits on the SyntaxGym benchmark. The results demonstrated that the composition function and the self-attention mechanism both play an important role to make LMs more human-like, and closer inspection of linguistic phenomenon implied that the composition function allowed syntactic features, but not semantic features, to percolate into subtree representations.","No"

To further investigate the effectiveness of structural linguistic priors, we conduct empirical study of replacing parsed graphs or trees with trivial ones (rarely carrying linguistic knowledge e.g., balanced tree) for tasks in the GLUE benchmark. Encoding with trivial graphs achieves competitive or even better performance in fully-supervised and few-shot settings. It reveals that the gains might not be significantly attributed to explicit linguistic priors but rather to more feature interactions brought by fusion layers.

"Subspace-based Set Operations on a Pre-trained Word Embedding Space","Yoichi Ishibashi, Sho Yokoi, Katsuhito Sudoh, Satoshi Nakamura",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13034","Word embedding is a fundamental technology in natural language processing. It is often exploited for tasks using sets of words, although standard methods for representing word sets and set operations remain limited. If we can leverage the advantage of word embedding for such set operations, we can calculate sentence similarity and find words that effectively share a concept with a given word set in a straightforward way. In this study, we formulate representations of sets and set operations in a pre-trained word embedding space. Inspired by \textit{quantum logic}, we propose a novel formulation of set operations using subspaces in a pre-trained word embedding space. Based on our definitions, we propose two metrics based on the degree to which a word belongs to a set and the similarity between embedding two sets. Our experiments with Text Concept Set Retrieval and Semantic Textual Similarity tasks demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method.","No"
"'Covid vaccine is against Covid but Oxford vaccine is made at Oxford!' Semantic Interpretation of Proper Noun Compounds","Keshav Kolluru and Gabriel Stanovsky and Mausam",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13039","Proper noun compounds, e.g., 'Covid vaccine', convey information in a succinct manner (a 'Covid vaccine' is a 'vaccine that immunizes against the Covid disease'). These are commonly used in short-form domains, such as news headlines, but are largely ignored in information-seeking applications. To address this limitation, we release a new manually annotated dataset, ProNCI, consisting of 22.5K proper noun compounds along with their free-form semantic interpretations. ProNCI is 60 times larger than prior noun compound datasets and also includes non-compositional examples, which have not been previously explored. We experiment with various neural models for automatically generating the semantic interpretations from proper noun compounds, ranging from few-shot prompting to supervised learning, with varying degrees of knowledge about the constituent nouns. We find that adding targeted knowledge, particularly about the common noun, results in performance gains of upto 2.8%. Finally, we integrate our model generated interpretations with an existing Open IE system and observe an 7.5% increase in yield at a precision of 85%.

"A non-sequential hierarchy of message-passing models","Cinzia Di Giusto (C&A), Davide Ferr\'e, Laetitia Laversa, Etienne Lozes",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13062","There is a wide variety of message-passing communication models, ranging from synchronous ''rendez-vous'' communications to fully asynchronous/out-of-order communications. For large-scale distributed systems, the communication model is determined by the transport layer of the network, and a few classes of orders of message delivery (FIFO, causally ordered) have been identified in the early days of distributed computing. For local-scale message-passing applications, e.g., running on a single machine, the communication model may be determined by the actual implementation of message buffers and by how FIFO queues are used. While large-scale communication models, such as causal ordering, are defined by logical axioms, local-scale models are often defined by an operational semantics. In this work, we connect these two approaches, and we present a unified hierarchy of communication models encompassing both large-scale and local-scale models, based on their non-sequential behaviors. We also show that all the communication models we consider can be axiomatised in the monadic second order logic, and may therefore benefit from several bounded verification techniques based on bounded special treewidth.

It comprises two subtasks: argumentative discourse unit recognition (ADUR) and argumentative relation extraction (ARE), both of which are challenging since they require e.g. the integration of domain knowledge, the detection of implicit statements, and the disambiguation of argument structure. While previous work focused on dataset construction and baseline methods for specific document sections, such as abstract or results, full-text scholarly argumentation mining has seen little progress. In this work, we introduce a sequential pipeline model combining ADUR and ARE for full-text SAM, and provide a first analysis of the performance of pretrained language models (PLMs) on both subtasks. We establish a new SotA for ADUR on the Sci-Arg corpus, outperforming the previous best reported result by a large margin (+7% F1). We also present the first results for ARE, and thus for the full AM pipeline, on this benchmark dataset. Our detailed error analysis reveals that non-contiguous ADUs as well as the interpretation of discourse connectors pose major challenges and that data annotation needs to be more consistent.","No"

"Unsupervised Term Extraction for Highly Technical Domains","Francesco Fusco, Peter Staar, Diego Antognini",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13118","Term extraction is an information extraction task at the root of knowledge discovery platforms. Developing term extractors that are able to generalize across very diverse and potentially highly technical domains is challenging, as annotations for domains requiring in-depth expertise are scarce and expensive to obtain. In this paper, we describe the term extraction subsystem of a commercial knowledge discovery platform that targets highly technical fields such as pharma, medical, and material science. To be able to generalize across domains, we introduce a fully unsupervised annotator (UA). It extracts terms by combining novel morphological signals from sub-word tokenization with term-to-topic and intra-term similarity metrics, computed using general-domain pre-trained sentence-encoders. The annotator is used to implement a weakly-supervised setup, where transformer-models are fine-tuned (or pre-trained) over the training data generated by running the UA over large unlabeled corpora. Our experiments demonstrate that our setup can improve the predictive performance while decreasing the inference latency on both CPUs and GPUs. Our annotators provide a very competitive baseline for all the cases where annotations are not available.","No"

In this paper, we investigate whether machine translating English multimodal data can be an effective proxy for the lack of readily available multilingual data. We call this framework TD-MML: Translated Data for Multilingual Multimodal Learning, and it can be applied to any multimodal dataset and model. We apply it to both pretraining and fine-tuning data with a state-of-the-art model. In order to prevent models from learning from low-quality translated text, we propose two metrics for automatically removing such translations from the resulting datasets. In experiments on five tasks across 20 languages in the IGLUE benchmark, we show that translated data can provide a useful signal for multilingual multimodal learning, both at pretraining and fine-tuning.","No"

Most approaches use hand-crafted features, but their efficacy relies on their particular underlying assumptions and they risk discarding potentially salient information about proficiency. Other approaches rely on transcriptions produced by ASR systems which may not provide a faithful rendition of a learner's utterance in specific scenarios (e.g., non-native children's spontaneous speech). Furthermore, transcriptions do not yield any information about relevant aspects such as intonation, rhythm or prosody. In this paper, we investigate the use of wav2vec 2.0 for assessing overall and individual aspects of proficiency on two small datasets, one of which is publicly available. We find that this approach significantly outperforms the BERT-based baseline system trained on ASR and manual transcriptions used for comparison.","No"

Rather than rules that operate on lexical items, it posits constructions as the central building blocks of language, i.e., linguistic units of different granularity that combine syntax and semantics. As a first step towards assessing the compatibility of CxG with the syntactic and semantic knowledge demonstrated by state-of-the-art pretrained language models (PLMs), we present an investigation of their capability to classify and understand one of the most commonly studied constructions, the English comparative correlative (CC). We conduct experiments examining the classification accuracy of a syntactic probe on the one hand and the models' behaviour in a semantic application task on the other, with BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa as the example PLMs. Our results show that all three investigated PLMs are able to recognise the structure of the CC but fail to use its meaning. While human-like performance of PLMs on many NLP tasks has been alleged, this indicates that PLMs still suffer from substantial shortcomings in central domains of linguistic knowledge.","No"
"Mutual Information Alleviates Hallucinations in Abstractive Summarization","Liam van der Poel, Ryan Cotterell, Clara Meister",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13210","Despite significant progress in the quality of language generated from abstractive summarization models, these models still exhibit the tendency to hallucinate, i.e., output content not supported by the source document. A number of works have tried to fix--or at least uncover the source of--the problem with limited success. In this paper, we identify a simple criterion under which models are significantly more likely to assign more probability to hallucinated content during generation: high model uncertainty. This finding offers a potential explanation for hallucinations: models default to favoring text with high marginal probability, i.e., high-frequency occurrences in the training set, when uncertain about a continuation. It also motivates possible routes for real-time intervention during decoding to prevent such hallucinations. We propose a decoding strategy that switches to optimizing for pointwise mutual information of the source and target token--rather than purely the probability of the target token--when the model exhibits uncertainty. Experiments on the XSum dataset show that our method decreases the probability of hallucinated tokens while maintaining the Rouge and BertS scores of top-performing decoding strategies.","No"

In the probing part of the model interpretability research, studies concern individual languages as well as individual linguistic structures. The question arises: are the detected regularities linguistically coherent, or on the contrary, do they dissonate at the typological scale? Moreover, the majority of studies address the inherent set of languages and linguistic structures, leaving the actual typological diversity knowledge out of scope. In this paper, we present and apply the GUI-assisted framework allowing us to easily probe a massive number of languages for all the morphosyntactic features present in the Universal Dependencies data. We show that reflecting the anglo-centric trend in NLP over the past years, most of the regularities revealed in the mBERT model are typical for the western-European languages. Our framework can be integrated with the existing probing toolboxes, model cards, and leaderboards, allowing practitioners to use and share their standard probing methods to interpret multilingual models.

We argue that the connecting rule as an additional prior may undermine the ability to reflect the model decision process faithfully. To this end, we propose to generate hierarchical explanations without the connecting rule and introduce a framework for generating hierarchical clusters. Experimental results and further analysis show the effectiveness of the proposed method in providing high-quality explanations for reflecting model predicting process.","No"

"ELMER: A Non-Autoregressive Pre-trained Language Model for Efficient and Effective Text Generation","Junyi Li, Tianyi Tang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Jian-Yun Nie and Ji-Rong Wen",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13304","We study the text generation task under the approach of pre-trained language models (PLMs). Typically, an auto-regressive (AR) method is adopted for generating texts in a token-by-token manner. Despite many advantages of AR generation, it usually suffers from inefficient inference. Therefore, non-autoregressive (NAR) models are proposed to generate all target tokens simultaneously. However, NAR models usually generate texts of lower quality due to the absence of token dependency in the output text. In this paper, we propose ELMER: an efficient and effective PLM for NAR text generation to explicitly model the token dependency during NAR generation. By leveraging the early exit technique, ELMER enables the token generations at different layers, according to their prediction confidence (a more confident token will exit at a lower layer). Besides, we propose a novel pre-training objective, Layer Permutation Language Modeling, to pre-train ELMER by permuting the exit layer for each token in sequences. Experiments on three text generation tasks show that ELMER significantly outperforms NAR models and further narrows the performance gap with AR PLMs (\eg ELMER (29.92) vs BART (30.61) ROUGE-L in XSUM) while achieving over 10 times inference speedup.","No"

Up to now, various DETs with distinct design elements have been proposed, achieving performance on par with fine-tuning. However, the mechanisms behind the above success are still under-explored, especially the connections among various DETs. To fathom the mystery, we hypothesize that the adaptations of different DETs could all be reparameterized as low-dimensional optimizations in a unified optimization subspace, which could be found by jointly decomposing independent solutions of different DETs. Then we explore the connections among different DETs by conducting optimization within the subspace. In experiments, we find that, for a certain DET, conducting optimization simply in the subspace could achieve comparable performance to its original space, and the found solution in the subspace could be transferred to another DET and achieve non-trivial performance. We also visualize the performance landscape of the subspace and find that there exists a substantial region where different DETs all perform well. Finally, we extend our analysis and show the strong connections between fine-tuning and DETs.","No"

As NLP systems are used in increasingly complex social situations, their ability to grasp social dynamics becomes crucial. In this work, we examine the open question of social intelligence and Theory of Mind in modern NLP systems from an empirical and theory-based perspective. We show that one of today's largest language models (GPT-3; Brown et al., 2020) lacks this kind of social intelligence out-of-the box, using two tasks: SocialIQa (Sap et al., 2019), which measures models' ability to understand intents and reactions of participants of social interactions, and ToMi (Le et al., 2019), which measures whether models can infer mental states and realities of participants of situations. Our results show that models struggle substantially at these Theory of Mind tasks, with well-below-human accuracies of 55% and 60% on SocialIQa and ToMi, respectively. To conclude, we draw on theories from pragmatics to contextualize this shortcoming of large language models, by examining the limitations stemming from their data, neural architecture, and training paradigms. Challenging the prevalent narrative that only scale is needed, we posit that person-centric NLP approaches might be more effective towards neural Theory of Mind.","No"

To deliver this feature in a more cost-efficient and environment-friendly way, we reduced the model complexity and size to ship the WavLM_SI model in client devices. In this paper, we first describe how we successfully improved the True Positive Rate (TPR) at a 1% False Positive Rate (FPR) from 50.9% to 68.3% for the failed speech interruption detection model by training on a larger dataset and fine-tuning.

Rush",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13352","Speech recognition applications cover a range of different audio and text distributions, with different speaking styles, background noise, transcription punctuation and character casing. However, many speech recognition systems require dataset-specific tuning (audio filtering, punctuation removal and normalisation of casing), therefore assuming a-priori knowledge of both the audio and text distributions. This tuning requirement can lead to systems failing to generalise to other datasets and domains. To promote the development of multi-domain speech systems, we introduce the End-to-end Speech Benchmark (ESB) for evaluating the performance of a single automatic speech recognition (ASR) system across a broad set of speech datasets. Benchmarked systems must use the same data pre- and post-processing algorithm across datasets - assuming the audio and text data distributions are a-priori unknown. We compare a series of state-of-the-art (SoTA) end-to-end (E2E) systems on this benchmark, demonstrating how a single speech system can be applied and evaluated on a wide range of data distributions. We find E2E systems to be effective across datasets: in a fair comparison, E2E systems achieve within 2.6% of SoTA systems tuned to a specific dataset. Our analysis reveals that transcription artefacts, such as punctuation and casing, pose difficulties for ASR systems and should be included in evaluation. We believe E2E benchmarking over a range of datasets promotes the research of multi-domain speech recognition systems. ESB is available at https://huggingface.co/esb.","No"

In this work, we propose a simple technique that significantly boosts the performance of LLMs without adding computational cost. Our key observation is that, by performing the next token prediction task with randomly selected past tokens masked out, we can improve the quality of the learned representations for downstream language understanding tasks. We hypothesize that randomly masking past tokens prevents over-attending to recent tokens and encourages attention to tokens in the distant past. By randomly masking input tokens in the PaLM model, we show that we can significantly improve 1B and 8B PaLM's zero-shot performance on the SuperGLUE benchmark from 55.7 to 59.2 and from 61.6 to 64.0, respectively. Our largest 8B model matches the score of PaLM with an average score of 64, despite the fact that PaLM is trained on a much larger dataset (780B tokens) of high-quality conversation and webpage data, while ours is trained on the smaller C4 dataset (180B tokens). Experimental results show that our method also improves PaLM's zero and few-shot performance on a diverse suite of tasks, including commonsense reasoning, natural language inference and cloze completion. Moreover, we show that our technique also helps representation learning, significantly improving PaLM's finetuning results.","No"
"Cascading Biases: Investigating the Effect of Heuristic Annotation Strategies on Data and Models","Chaitanya Malaviya, Sudeep Bhatia, Mark Yatskar",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13439","Cognitive psychologists have documented that humans use cognitive heuristics, or mental shortcuts, to make quick decisions while expending less effort. While performing annotation work on crowdsourcing platforms, we hypothesize that such heuristic use among annotators cascades on to data quality and model robustness. In this work, we study cognitive heuristic use in the context of annotating multiple-choice reading comprehension datasets. We propose tracking annotator heuristic traces, where we tangibly measure low-effort annotation strategies that could indicate usage of various cognitive heuristics. We find evidence that annotators might be using multiple such heuristics, based on correlations with a battery of psychological tests. Importantly, heuristic use among annotators determines data quality along several dimensions: (1) known biased models, such as partial input models, more easily solve examples authored by annotators that rate highly on heuristic use, (2) models trained on annotators scoring highly on heuristic use don't generalize as well, and (3) heuristic-seeking annotators tend to create qualitatively less challenging examples. Our findings suggest that tracking heuristic usage among annotators can potentially help with collecting challenging datasets and diagnosing model biases.","No"

In this work, we propose a novel dataset, called EUR-Lex-Sum, based on manually curated document summaries of legal acts from the European Union law platform (EUR-Lex). Documents and their respective summaries exist as cross-lingual paragraph-aligned data in several of the 24 official European languages, enabling access to various cross-lingual and lower-resourced summarization setups. We obtain up to 1,500 document/summary pairs per language, including a subset of 375 cross-lingually aligned legal acts with texts available in all 24 languages. In this work, the data acquisition process is detailed and key characteristics of the resource are compared to existing summarization resources. In particular, we illustrate challenging sub-problems and open questions on the dataset that could help the facilitation of future research in the direction of domain-specific cross-lingual summarization. Limited by the extreme length and language diversity of samples, we further conduct experiments with suitable extractive monolingual and cross-lingual baselines for future work.

"Controlled Text Reduction","Aviv Slobodkin, Paul Roit, Eran Hirsch, Ori Ernst, Ido Dagan",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13449","Producing a reduced version of a source text, as in generic or focused summarization, inherently involves two distinct subtasks: deciding on targeted content and generating a coherent text conveying it. While some popular approaches address summarization as a single end-to-end task, prominent works support decomposed modeling for individual subtasks. Further, semi-automated text reduction is also very appealing, where users may identify targeted content while models would generate a corresponding coherent summary. In this paper, we focus on the second subtask, of generating coherent text given pre-selected content. Concretely, we formalize \textit{Controlled Text Reduction} as a standalone task, whose input is a source text with marked spans of targeted content ('highlighting'). A model then needs to generate a coherent text that includes all and only the target information. We advocate the potential of such models, both for modular fully-automatic summarization, as well as for semi-automated human-in-the-loop use cases. Facilitating proper research, we crowdsource high-quality dev and test datasets for the task. Further, we automatically generate a larger 'silver' training dataset from available summarization benchmarks, leveraging a pretrained summary-source alignment model. Finally, employing these datasets, we present a supervised baseline model, showing promising results and insightful analyses.","No"

Such a capability would allow better understanding of why a model produced the answer it did. Our approach is to recursively combine a trained backward-chaining model, capable of generating a set of premises entailing an answer hypothesis, with a verifier that checks that the model itself believes those premises (and the entailment itself) through self-querying. To our knowledge, this is the first system to generate multistep chains that are both faithful (the answer follows from the reasoning) and truthful (the chain reflects the system's own internal beliefs). In evaluation using two different datasets, users judge that a majority (70%+) of generated chains clearly show how an answer follows from a set of facts - substantially better than a high-performance baseline - while preserving answer accuracy. By materializing model beliefs that systematically support an answer, new opportunities arise for understanding the model's system of belief, and diagnosing and correcting its misunderstandings when an answer is wrong.","No"

Almost all existing VG work holds two simple but unrealistic assumptions: 1) All query sentences can be grounded in the corresponding video. 2) All query sentences for the same video are always at the same semantic scale. Unfortunately, both assumptions make today's VG models fail to work in practice. For example, in real-world multimodal assets (eg, news articles), most of the sentences in the article can not be grounded in their affiliated videos, and they typically have rich hierarchical relations (ie, at different semantic scales). To this end, we propose a new challenging grounding task: Weakly-Supervised temporal Article Grounding (WSAG). Specifically, given an article and a relevant video, WSAG aims to localize all ``groundable'' sentences to the video, and these sentences are possibly at different semantic scales. Accordingly, we collect the first WSAG dataset to facilitate this task: YouwikiHow, which borrows the inherent multi-scale descriptions in wikiHow articles and plentiful YouTube videos. In addition, we propose a simple but effective method DualMIL for WSAG, which consists of a two-level MIL loss and a single-/cross- sentence constraint loss. These training objectives are carefully designed for these relaxed assumptions. Extensive ablations have verified the effectiveness of DualMIL.","No"

However, most of these agents are reactive, meaning that they simply learn and imitate behaviors encountered in the training data. These reactive agents are insufficient for long-horizon complex tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a neuro-symbolic deliberative agent that, while following language instructions, proactively applies reasoning and planning based on its neural and symbolic representations acquired from past experience (e.g., natural language and egocentric vision). We show that our deliberative agent achieves greater than 70% improvement over reactive baselines on the challenging TEACh benchmark. Moreover, the underlying reasoning and planning processes, together with our modular framework, offer impressive transparency and explainability to the behaviors of the agent. This enables an in-depth understanding of the agent's capabilities, which shed light on challenges and opportunities for future embodied agents for instruction following.

Current explanation datasets often employ synthetic data with simple reasoning structures. Therefore, it cannot express more complex reasoning processes, such as the rebuttal to a reasoning step and the degree of certainty of the evidence. To this end, we propose a comprehensive logical reasoning explanation form. Based on the multi-hop chain of reasoning, the explanation form includes three main components: (1) The condition of rebuttal that the reasoning node can be challenged; (2) Logical formulae that uncover the internal texture of reasoning nodes; (3) Reasoning strength indicated by degrees of certainty. The fine-grained structure conforms to the real logical reasoning scenario, better fitting the human cognitive process but, simultaneously, is more challenging for the current models. We evaluate the current best models' performance on this new explanation form. The experimental results show that generating reasoning graphs remains a challenging task for current models, even with the help of giant pre-trained language models.","No"

In these situations, what is immediately available to vehicles is often only human operators. Empowering autonomous driving agents with the ability to navigate in a continuous and dynamic environment and to communicate with humans through sensorimotor-grounded dialogue becomes critical. To this end, we introduce Dialogue On the ROad To Handle Irregular Events (DOROTHIE), a novel interactive simulation platform that enables the creation of unexpected situations on the fly to support empirical studies on situated communication with autonomous driving agents. Based on this platform, we created the Situated Dialogue Navigation (SDN), a navigation benchmark of 183 trials with a total of 8415 utterances, around 18.7 hours of control streams, and 2.9 hours of trimmed audio. SDN is developed to evaluate the agent's ability to predict dialogue moves from humans as well as generate its own dialogue moves and physical navigation actions. We further developed a transformer-based baseline model for these SDN tasks. Our empirical results indicate that language guided-navigation in a highly dynamic environment is an extremely difficult task for end-to-end models. These results will provide insight towards future work on robust autonomous driving agents.

Empirically, we demonstrate that LMPriors improve model performance in settings where such natural language descriptions are available, and perform well on several tasks that benefit from such prior knowledge, such as feature selection, causal inference, and safe reinforcement learning.","No"

In this work, we provide an alternative to hard negative mining in supervised contrastive learning, Tail Batch Sampling (TBS), an efficient approximation to the batch assignment problem that upper bounds the gap between the global and training losses, $\mathcal{L}^{Global} - \mathcal{L}^{Train}$.

We introduce a novel dataset of 300,000 online games of Cards Against Humanity, including 785K unique jokes, analyze it and provide insights. We trained machine learning models to predict the winning joke per game, achieving performance twice as good (20\%) as random, even without any user information. On the more difficult task of judging novel cards, we see the models' ability to generalize is moderate. Interestingly, we find that our models are primarily focused on punchline card, with the context having little impact. Analyzing feature importance, we observe that short, crude, juvenile punchlines tend to win.","No"

Modeling REG and REC simultaneously for utilizing the relation between them is a promising way to improve both. However, the problem of distinct inputs, as well as building connections between them in a single model, brings challenges to the design and training of the joint model. To address the problems, we propose a unified model for REG and REC, named UniRef. It unifies these two tasks with the carefully-designed Image-Region-Text Fusion layer (IRTF), which fuses the image, region and text via the image cross-attention and region cross-attention. Additionally, IRTF could generate pseudo input regions for the REC task to enable a uniform way for sharing the identical representation space across the REC and REG. We further propose Vision-conditioned Masked Language Modeling (VMLM) and Text-Conditioned Region Prediction (TRP) to pre-train UniRef model on multi-granular corpora. The VMLM and TRP are directly related to REG and REC, respectively, but could help each other. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg.

"Can Visual Context Improve Automatic Speech Recognition for an Embodied Agent?","Pradip Pramanick, Chayan Sarkar",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13189","The usage of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are becoming omnipresent ranging from personal assistant to chatbots, home, and industrial automation systems, etc. Modern robots are also equipped with ASR capabilities for interacting with humans as speech is the most natural interaction modality. However, ASR in robots faces additional challenges as compared to a personal assistant. Being an embodied agent, a robot must recognize the physical entities around it and therefore reliably recognize the speech containing the description of such entities. However, current ASR systems are often unable to do so due to limitations in ASR training, such as generic datasets and open-vocabulary modeling. Also, adverse conditions during inference, such as noise, accented, and far-field speech makes the transcription inaccurate. In this work, we present a method to incorporate a robot's visual information into an ASR system and improve the recognition of a spoken utterance containing a visible entity. Specifically, we propose a new decoder biasing technique to incorporate the visual context while ensuring the ASR output does not degrade for incorrect context. We achieve a 59% relative reduction in WER from an unmodified ASR system.","No"

To address this limitation, we propose SODAPOP (SOcial bias Discovery from Answers about PeOPle) in social commonsense question-answering. Our pipeline generates modified instances from the Social IQa dataset (Sap et al., 2019) by (1) substituting names associated with different demographic groups, and (2) generating many distractor answers from a masked language model. By using a social commonsense model to score the generated distractors, we are able to uncover the model's stereotypic associations between demographic groups and an open set of words.

However, relevant information required to generate responses may also reside in unstructured sources, such as documents.

For instance, these systems assume that certain types of information, such as a phone number, is always present in a structured KB while information about aspects such as entrance ticket prices would always be available in documents. In this paper, we create a modified version of the MutliWOZ based dataset prepared by SeKnow to demonstrate how current methods have significant degradation in performance when strict assumptions about the source of information are removed. Then, in line with recent work exploiting pre-trained language models, we fine-tune a BART based model using prompts for the tasks of querying knowledge sources, as well as, for response generation, without making assumptions about the information present in each knowledge source.

While probing the language models has led to insightful findings, they appear disjointed from the development of models. This paper explores the utility of probing deep NLP models to extract a proxy signal widely used in model development -- the fine-tuning performance.

In this work, we investigate whether these previous findings still hold with state-of-the-art pretrained Transformer-based language models (PLMs). We use three common specialization methods proven effective for incorporating external knowledge into pretrained Transformers (e.g., domain-specific or geographic knowledge). We adapt the language representations for the demographic dimensions of gender and age, using continuous language modeling and dynamic multi-task learning for adaptation, where we couple language modeling objectives with the prediction of demographic classes. Our results when employing a multilingual PLM show substantial performance gains across four languages (English, German, French, and Danish), which is consistent with the results of previous work. However, controlling for confounding factors -- primarily domain and language proficiency of Transformer-based PLMs -- shows that downstream performance gains from our demographic adaptation do not actually stem from demographic knowledge. Our results indicate that demographic specialization of PLMs, while holding promise for positive societal impact, still represents an unsolved problem for (modern) NLP.","No"
"Is It Worth the (Environmental) Cost? Limited Evidence for the Benefits of Diachronic Continuous Training","Giuseppe Attanasio, Debora Nozza, Federico Bianchi, Dirk Hovy",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07365","Language is constantly changing and evolving, leaving language models to quickly become outdated, both factually and linguistically. Recent research proposes we continuously update our models using new data. Continuous training allows us to teach language models about new events and facts and changing norms. However, continuous training also means continuous costs. We show there is currently limited evidence for the benefits of continuous training, be it for the actual downstream performance or the environmental cost. Our results show continuous training does not significantly improve performance. While it is clear that, sooner or later, our language models need to be updated, it is unclear when this effort is worth the cost. We call for a critical reflection about when and how to use continuous training and for more benchmarks to support this research direction.","No"
"M2D2: A Massively Multi-domain Language Modeling Dataset","Machel Reid, Victor Zhong, Suchin Gururangan, Luke Zettlemoyer",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07370","We present M2D2, a fine-grained, massively multi-domain corpus for studying domain adaptation in language models (LMs). M2D2 consists of 8.5B tokens and spans 145 domains extracted from Wikipedia and Semantic Scholar. Using ontologies derived from Wikipedia and ArXiv categories, we organize the domains in each data source into 22 groups. This two-level hierarchy enables the study of relationships between domains and their effects on in- and out-of-domain performance after adaptation. We also present a number of insights into the nature of effective domain adaptation in LMs, as examples of the new types of studies M2D2 enables. To improve in-domain performance, we show the benefits of adapting the LM along a domain hierarchy; adapting to smaller amounts of fine-grained domain-specific data can lead to larger in-domain performance gains than larger amounts of weakly relevant data. We further demonstrate a trade-off between in-domain specialization and out-of-domain generalization within and across ontologies, as well as a strong correlation between out-of-domain performance and lexical overlap between domains.","No"

However, the models are well-known in producing semantically inaccurate outputs if these labels are ambiguous or incomplete, which is often the case in D2T datasets. In this paper, we expose this issue on the task of descibing a relation between two entities. For our experiments, we collect a novel dataset for verbalizing a diverse set of 1,522 unique relations from three large-scale knowledge graphs (Wikidata, DBPedia, YAGO). We find that although PLMs for D2T generation expectedly fail on unclear cases, models trained with a large variety of relation labels are surprisingly robust in verbalizing novel, unseen relations. We argue that using data with a diverse set of clear and meaningful labels is key to training D2T generation systems capable of generalizing to novel domains.","No"

Mohammad",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07381","Automatically generated emotion arcs -- that capture how an individual or a population feels over time -- are widely used in industry and research. However, there is little work on evaluating the generated arcs. This is in part due to the difficulty of establishing the true (gold) emotion arc. Our work, for the first time, systematically and quantitatively evaluates automatically generated emotion arcs. We also compare two common ways of generating emotion arcs: Machine-Learning (ML) models and Lexicon-Only (LexO) methods. Using a number of diverse datasets, we systematically study the relationship between the quality of an emotion lexicon and the quality of the emotion arc that can be generated with it. We also study the relationship between the quality of an instance-level emotion detection system (say from an ML model) and the quality of emotion arcs that can be generated with it. We show that despite being markedly poor at instance level, LexO methods are highly accurate at generating emotion arcs by aggregating information from hundreds of instances. This has wide-spread implications for commercial development, as well as research in psychology, public health, digital humanities, etc. that values simple interpretable methods and disprefers the need for domain-specific training data, programming expertise, and high-carbon-footprint models.","No"

Because we want to avoid missing out on opportunities or making fruitless actions after they have disappeared, it is important to know when entities disappear as early as possible. We thus tackle the task of detecting disappearing entities from microblogs, whose posts mention various entities, in a timely manner. The major challenge is detecting uncertain contexts of disappearing entities from noisy microblog posts. To collect these disappearing contexts, we design time-sensitive distant supervision, which utilizes entities from the knowledge base and time-series posts, for this task to build large-scale Twitter datasets\footnote{We will release the datasets (tweet IDs) used in the experiments to promote reproducibility.} for English and Japanese. To ensure robust detection in noisy environments, we refine pretrained word embeddings of the detection model on microblog streams of the target day. Experimental results on the Twitter datasets confirmed the effectiveness of the collected labeled data and refined word embeddings; more than 70\% of the detected disappearing entities in Wikipedia are discovered earlier than the update on Wikipedia, and the average lead-time is over one month.","No"
"Noise Audits Improve Moral Foundation Classification","Negar Mokhberian, Frederic R. Hopp, Bahareh Harandizadeh, Fred Morstatter, Kristina Lerman",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07415","Morality plays an important role in culture, identity, and emotion. Recent advances in natural language processing have shown that it is possible to classify moral values expressed in text at scale. Morality classification relies on human annotators to label the moral expressions in text, which provides training data to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, these annotations are inherently subjective and some of the instances are hard to classify, resulting in noisy annotations due to error or lack of agreement. The presence of noise in training data harms the classifier's ability to accurately recognize moral foundations from text. We propose two metrics to audit the noise of annotations. The first metric is entropy of instance labels, which is a proxy measure of annotator disagreement about how the instance should be labeled. The second metric is the silhouette coefficient of a label assigned by an annotator to an instance. This metric leverages the idea that instances with the same label should have similar latent representations, and deviations from collective judgments are indicative of errors. Our experiments on three widely used moral foundations datasets show that removing noisy annotations based on the proposed metrics improves classification performance.","No"

In our experiments, we design tailored setups to test model's generalization abilities. We find our PCFG-based command generation approach is effective for handling unseen commands compared to fix-set templates; our proposed NL models can effectively generalize to unseen attributes, a new ability enabled by the NL interface, as well as unseen attribute combinations. Interestingly, we discover that the simple conditional generation approach, enhanced with our proposed NL interface, is a strong baseline in those challenging settings.","No"

We show that an interactive setup with users enabled to provide feedback can achieve a better and fair balance between task performance and bias mitigation, supported by faithful explanations.","No"

However, such success is hard to be replicated in other languages, where we only have limited annotations.In this paper, based on the multilingual lexicon BabelNet describing the same set of concepts across languages, we propose building knowledge and supervised-based Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation (MWSD) systems. We build unified sense representations for multiple languages and address the annotation scarcity problem for MWSD by transferring annotations from rich-sourced languages to poorer ones. With the unified sense representations, annotations from multiple languages can be jointly trained to benefit the MWSD tasks.

"Controlling Bias Exposure for Fair Interpretable Predictions","Zexue He, Yu Wang, Julian McAuley, Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07455","Recent work on reducing bias in NLP models usually focuses on protecting or isolating information related to a sensitive attribute (like gender or race). However, when sensitive information is semantically entangled with the task information of the input, e.g., the gender information is predictive for a profession, a fair trade-off between task performance and bias mitigation is difficult to achieve. Existing approaches perform this trade-off by eliminating bias information from the latent space, lacking control over how much bias is necessarily required to be removed. We argue that a favorable debiasing method should use sensitive information 'fairly' rather than blindly eliminating it (Caliskan et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2019). In this work, we provide a novel debiasing algorithm by adjusting the predictive model's belief to (1) ignore the sensitive information if it is not useful for the task; (2) use sensitive information minimally as necessary for the prediction (while also incurring a penalty). Experimental results on two text classification tasks (influenced by gender) and an open-ended generation task (influenced by race) indicate that our model achieves a desirable trade-off between debiasing and task performance along with producing debiased rationales as evidence.","No"

However, when denotations are changed to be context-dependent with the language otherwise unmodified, this ability degrades. Turning to natural language, our experiments with a specific phenomenon -- referential opacity -- add to the growing body of evidence that current language models do not well-represent natural language semantics. We show this failure relates to the context-dependent nature of natural language form-meaning mappings.","No"

Large pre-trained language models produce impressive results on various style classification tasks. However, they often learn spurious domain-specific words to make predictions. This incorrect word importance learned by the model often leads to ambiguous token-level explanations which do not align with human perception of linguistic styles. To tackle this challenge, we introduce StyLEx, a model that learns annotated human perceptions of stylistic lexica and uses these stylistic words as additional information for predicting the style of a sentence. Our experiments show that StyLEx can provide human-like stylistic lexical explanations without sacrificing the performance of sentence-level style prediction on both original and out-of-domain datasets. Explanations from StyLEx show higher sufficiency, and plausibility when compared to human annotations, and are also more understandable by human judges compared to the existing widely-used saliency baseline.","No"

On the basis of the observations that token averaging and layer combination contribute to improving OOD detection, we propose a simple embedding approach named Avg-Avg, which averages all token representations from each intermediate layer as the sentence embedding and significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks by a 9.33% FAR95 margin. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that it indeed helps preserve general linguistic knowledge in fine-tuned PLMs and substantially benefits detecting background shifts. The simple yet effective embedding method can be applied to fine-tuned PLMs with negligible extra costs, providing a free gain in OOD detection.

Meta-path, a sequence of node types and edge types, is the core technique to embed HINs. Since manually curating meta-paths is time-consuming, there is a pressing need to develop automated meta-path generation approaches. Existing meta-path generation approaches cannot fully exploit the rich textual information in HINs, such as node names and edge type names. To address this problem, we propose MetaFill, a text-infilling-based approach for meta-path generation. The key idea of MetaFill is to formulate meta-path identification problem as a word sequence infilling problem, which can be advanced by Pretrained Language Models (PLMs). We observed the superior performance of MetaFill against existing meta-path generation methods and graph embedding methods that do not leverage meta-paths in both link prediction and node classification on two real-world HIN datasets. We further demonstrated how MetaFill can accurately classify edges in the zero-shot setting, where existing approaches cannot generate any meta-paths. MetaFill exploits PLMs to generate meta-paths for graph embedding, opening up new avenues for language model applications in graph analysis.","No"

In this paper, we propose a Psychology-guIded Controllable Story Generation System (PICS) to generate stories that adhere to the given leading context and desired psychological state chains for the protagonist. Specifically, psychological state trackers are employed to memorize the protagonist's local psychological states to capture their inner temporal relationships. In addition, psychological state planners are adopted to gain the protagonist's global psychological states for story planning. Eventually, a psychology controller is designed to integrate the local and global psychological states into the story context representation for composing psychology-guided stories. Automatic and manual evaluations demonstrate that PICS outperforms baselines, and each part of PICS shows effectiveness for writing stories with more consistent psychological changes.","No"

The Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion is widely used in multiple seq2seq tasks. Besides predicting the target sequence, a side product of CTC is to predict the alignment, which is the most probable input-long sequence that specifies a hard aligning relationship between the input and target units. As there are multiple potential aligning sequences (called paths) that are equally considered in CTC formulation, the choice of which path will be most probable and become the predicted alignment is always uncertain. In addition, it is usually observed that the alignment predicted by vanilla CTC will drift compared with its reference and rarely provides practical functionalities. Thus, the motivation of this work is to make the CTC alignment prediction controllable and thus equip CTC with extra functionalities. The Bayes risk CTC (BRCTC) criterion is then proposed in this work, in which a customizable Bayes risk function is adopted to enforce the desired characteristics of the predicted alignment. With the risk function, the BRCTC is a general framework to adopt some customizable preference over the paths in order to concentrate the posterior into a particular subset of the paths. In applications, we explore one particular preference which yields models with the down-sampling ability and reduced inference costs. By using BRCTC with another preference for early emissions, we obtain an improved performance-latency trade-off for online models. Experimentally, the proposed BRCTC reduces the inference cost of offline models by up to 47% without performance degradation and cuts down the overall latency of online systems to an unseen level.","No"
"Can Language Representation Models Think in Bets?","Zhisheng Tang, Mayank Kejriwal",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07519","In recent years, transformer-based language representation models (LRMs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on difficult natural language understanding problems, such as question answering and text summarization. As these models are integrated into real-world applications, evaluating their ability to make rational decisions is an important research agenda, with practical ramifications. This article investigates LRMs' rational decision-making ability through a carefully designed set of decision-making benchmarks and experiments. Inspired by classic work in cognitive science, we model the decision-making problem as a bet. We then investigate an LRM's ability to choose outcomes that have optimal, or at minimum, positive expected gain. Through a robust body of experiments on four established LRMs, we show that a model is only able to `think in bets' if it is first fine-tuned on bet questions with an identical structure. Modifying the bet question's structure, while still retaining its fundamental characteristics, decreases an LRM's performance by more than 25\%, on average, although absolute performance remains well above random. LRMs are also found to be more rational when selecting outcomes with non-negative expected gain, rather than optimal or strictly positive expected gain. Our results suggest that LRMs could potentially be applied to tasks that rely on cognitive decision-making skills, but that more research is necessary before they can robustly make rational decisions.","No"

We show that PLMs can be watermarked with a multi-task learning framework by embedding backdoors triggered by specific inputs defined by the owners, and those watermarks are hard to remove even though the watermarked PLMs are fine-tuned on multiple downstream tasks. In addition to using some rare words as triggers, we also show that the combination of common words can be used as backdoor triggers to avoid them being easily detected.

While LoRA blocks are parameter efficient, they suffer from two major problems: first, the size of these blocks is fixed and cannot be modified after training (for example, if we need to change the rank of LoRA blocks, then we need to re-train them from scratch); second, optimizing their rank requires an exhaustive search and effort. In this work, we introduce a dynamic low-rank adaptation (DyLoRA) technique to address these two problems together. Our DyLoRA method trains LoRA blocks for a range of ranks instead of a single rank by sorting out the representation learned by the adapter module at different ranks during training. We evaluate our solution on different tasks of the GLUE benchmark using the RoBERTa model. Our results show that we can train dynamic search-free models with DyLoRA at least $7\times$ faster than LoRA without significantly compromising performance. Moreover, our models can perform consistently well on a much larger range of ranks compared to LoRA.","No"
"Q-TOD: A Query-driven Task-oriented Dialogue System","Xin Tian, Yingzhan Lin, Mengfei Song, Siqi Bao, Fan Wang, Huang He, Shuqi Sun, Hua Wu",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07564","Existing pipelined task-oriented dialogue systems usually have difficulties adapting to unseen domains, whereas end-to-end systems are plagued by large-scale knowledge bases in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel query-driven task-oriented dialogue system, namely Q-TOD. The essential information from the dialogue context is extracted into a query, which is further employed to retrieve relevant knowledge records for response generation. Firstly, as the query is in the form of natural language and not confined to the schema of the knowledge base, the issue of domain adaption is alleviated remarkably in Q-TOD. Secondly, as the query enables the decoupling of knowledge retrieval from the generation, Q-TOD gets rid of the issue of knowledge base scalability. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed Q-TOD, we collect query annotations for three publicly available task-oriented dialogue datasets. Comprehensive experiments verify that Q-TOD outperforms strong baselines and establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.","No"
"Multi-Task Pre-Training of Modular Prompt for Few-Shot Learning","Tianxiang Sun, Zhengfu He, Qin Zhu, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07565","Prompt tuning is a parameter-efficient approach to adapting pre-trained language models to downstream tasks. Although prompt tuning has been shown to match the performance of full model tuning when training data is sufficient, it tends to struggle in few-shot learning settings. In this paper, we present Multi-task Pre-trained Modular Prompt (MP2) to boost prompt tuning for few-shot learning. MP2 is a set of combinable prompts pre-trained on 38 Chinese tasks. On downstream tasks, the pre-trained prompts are selectively activated and combined, leading to strong compositional generalization to unseen tasks. To bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, we formulate upstream and downstream tasks into a unified machine reading comprehension task. Extensive experiments under two learning paradigms, i.e., gradient descent and black-box tuning, show that MP2 significantly outperforms prompt tuning, full model tuning, and prior prompt pre-training methods in few-shot settings. In addition, we demonstrate that MP2 can achieve surprisingly fast and strong adaptation to downstream tasks by merely learning 8 parameters to combine the pre-trained modular prompts.","No"
"A Survey of Parameters Associated with the Quality of Benchmarks in NLP","Swaroop Mishra, Anjana Arunkumar, Chris Bryan and Chitta Baral",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07566","Several benchmarks have been built with heavy investment in resources to track our progress in NLP. Thousands of papers published in response to those benchmarks have competed to top leaderboards, with models often surpassing human performance. However, recent studies have shown that models triumph over several popular benchmarks just by overfitting on spurious biases, without truly learning the desired task. Despite this finding, benchmarking, while trying to tackle bias, still relies on workarounds, which do not fully utilize the resources invested in benchmark creation, due to the discarding of low quality data, and cover limited sets of bias. A potential solution to these issues -- a metric quantifying quality -- remains underexplored. Inspired by successful quality indices in several domains such as power, food, and water, we take the first step towards a metric by identifying certain language properties that can represent various possible interactions leading to biases in a benchmark. We look for bias related parameters which can potentially help pave our way towards the metric. We survey existing works and identify parameters capturing various properties of bias, their origins, types and impact on performance, generalization, and robustness. Our analysis spans over datasets and a hierarchy of tasks ranging from NLI to Summarization, ensuring that our parameters are generic and are not overfitted towards a specific task or dataset. We also develop certain parameters in this process.","No"

MICO generates the commonsense knowledge representation by contextual interaction between entity nodes and relations with multi-alternative contrastive learning. In MICO, the head and tail entities in an $(h,r,t)$ knowledge triple are converted to two relation-aware sequence pairs (a premise and an alternative) in the form of natural language. Semantic representations generated by MICO can benefit the following two tasks by simply comparing the distance score between the representations: 1) zero-shot commonsense question answering task; 2) inductive commonsense knowledge graph completion task.

"Automatic Creation of Named Entity Recognition Datasets by Querying Phrase Representations","Hyunjae Kim, Jaehyo Yoo, Seunghyun Yoon, Jaewoo Kang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07586","Most weakly supervised named entity recognition (NER) models rely on domain-specific dictionaries provided by experts. This approach is infeasible in many domains where dictionaries do not exist. While a phrase retrieval model was used to construct pseudo-dictionaries with entities retrieved from Wikipedia automatically in a recent study, these dictionaries often have limited coverage because the retriever is likely to retrieve popular entities rather than rare ones. In this study, a phrase embedding search to efficiently create high-coverage dictionaries is presented. Specifically, the reformulation of natural language queries into phrase representations allows the retriever to search a space densely populated with various entities. In addition, we present a novel framework, HighGEN, that generates NER datasets with high-coverage dictionaries obtained using the phrase embedding search. HighGEN generates weak labels based on the distance between the embeddings of a candidate phrase and target entity type to reduce the noise in high-coverage dictionaries. We compare HighGEN with current weakly supervised NER models on six NER benchmarks and demonstrate the superiority of our models.","No"
"ConEntail: An Entailment-based Framework for Universal Zero and Few Shot Classification with Supervised Contrastive Pretraining","Haoran Zhang, Aysa Xuemo Fan and Rui Zhang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07587","A universal classification model aims to generalize to diverse classification tasks in both zero and few shot settings. A promising way toward universal classification is to cast heterogeneous data formats into a dataset-agnostic 'meta-task' (e.g., textual entailment, question answering) then pretrain a model on the combined meta dataset. The existing work is either pretrained on specific subsets of classification tasks, or pretrained on both classification and generation data but the model could not fulfill its potential in universality and reliability. These also leave a massive amount of annotated data under-exploited. To fill these gaps, we propose ConEntail, a new framework for universal zero and few shot classification with supervised contrastive pretraining. Our unified meta-task for classification is based on nested entailment. It can be interpreted as 'Does sentence a entails [sentence b entails label c]'. This formulation enables us to make better use of 57 annotated classification datasets for supervised contrastive pretraining and universal evaluation. In this way, ConEntail helps the model (1) absorb knowledge from different datasets, and (2) gain consistent performance gain with more pretraining data. In experiments, we compare our model with discriminative and generative models pretrained on the same dataset. The results confirm that our framework effectively exploits existing annotated data and consistently outperforms baselines in both zero (9.4% average improvement) and few shot settings (3.5% average improvement).","No"
"The State of Profanity Obfuscation in Natural Language Processing","Debora Nozza, Dirk Hovy",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07595","Work on hate speech has made the consideration of rude and harmful examples in scientific publications inevitable. This raises various problems, such as whether or not to obscure profanities. While science must accurately disclose what it does, the unwarranted spread of hate speech is harmful to readers, and increases its internet frequency. While maintaining publications' professional appearance, obfuscating profanities makes it challenging to evaluate the content, especially for non-native speakers. Surveying 150 ACL papers, we discovered that obfuscation is usually employed for English but not other languages, and even so quite uneven. We discuss the problems with obfuscation and suggest a multilingual community resource called PrOf that has a Python module to standardize profanity obfuscation processes. We believe PrOf can help scientific publication policies to make hate speech work accessible and comparable, irrespective of language.","No"
"Mention Annotations Alone Enable Efficient Domain Adaptation for Coreference Resolution","Nupoor Gandhi, Anjalie Field, Emma Strubell",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07602","Although, recent advances in neural network models for coreference resolution have led to substantial improvements on benchmark datasets, it remains a challenge to successfully transfer those models to new target domains containing many out-of-vocabulary spans and requiring differing annotation schemes. Typical approaches for domain adaptation involve continued training on coreference annotations in the target domain, but obtaining those annotations is costly and time-consuming. In this work, we show that adapting mention detection is the key component to successful domain adaptation of coreference models, rather than antecedent linking. Through timed annotation experiments, we also show annotating mentions alone is nearly twice as fast as annotating full coreference chains. Based on these insights, we propose a method for effectively adapting coreference models that requires only mention annotations in the target domain. We use an auxiliary mention detection objective trained with mention examples in the target domain resulting in higher mention precision. We demonstrate that our approach facilitates sample- and time-efficient transfer to new annotation schemes and lexicons in extensive evaluation across three English coreference datasets: CoNLL-2012 (news/conversation), i2b2/VA (medical case notes), and a dataset of child welfare case notes. We show that annotating mentions results in 7-14% improvement in average F1 over annotating coreference over an equivalent amount of time.","No"

The one-hop annotation manner made ATOMIC a set of independent bipartite graphs, which ignored the numerous missing links between events in different bipartite graphs and consequently caused shortcomings in knowledge coverage and multi-hop reasoning. To address these issues, we propose a CSKG completion approach by training a relation prediction model based on a set of existing triplets, and infer the missing links on ATOMIC. On this basis, we construct Dense-ATOMIC, a densely-connected and multi-hop commonsense knowledge graph. The experimental results on an annotated dense subgraph demonstrate the effectiveness of our CSKG completion approach upon ATOMIC. The evaluation on a downstream commonsense reasoning task also proves the advantage of Dense-ATOMIC against conventional ATOMIC.","No"

In recent years, pre-trained language model (PLM) based metrics, such as BERTScore, have been commonly adopted in various generation tasks. However, it has been demonstrated that PLMs encode a range of stereotypical societal biases, leading to a concern on the fairness of PLMs as metrics. To that end, this work presents the first systematic study on the social bias in PLM-based metrics. We demonstrate that popular PLM-based metrics exhibit significantly higher social bias than traditional metrics on 6 sensitive attributes, namely race, gender, religion, physical appearance, age, and socioeconomic status. In-depth analysis suggests that choosing paradigms (matching, regression, or generation) of the metric has a greater impact on fairness than choosing PLMs. In addition, we develop debiasing adapters that are injected into PLM layers, mitigating bias in PLM-based metrics while retaining high performance for evaluating text generation.","No"

We propose a Data Scoring task that requires assignment of each unannotated sample in a benchmark a score between 0 to 1, where 0 signifies easy and 1 signifies hard. Use of unannotated samples in our task design is inspired from humans who can determine a question difficulty without knowing its correct answer. This also rules out the use of methods involving model based supervision (since they require sample annotations to get trained), eliminating potential biases associated with models in deciding sample difficulty. We propose a method based on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) for this task; we validate our method by showing that existing models are more accurate with respect to the easier sample-chunks than with respect to the harder sample-chunks.

First, we generate value-aligned training data from LLMs by prompt-based few-shot learning. Next, we fine-tune smaller classification models with the generated data for the task. Empirical results show that our VA-Models surpass multiple baselines by at least 15.56% on the F1-score, including few-shot learning with OPT-175B and existing text augmentation methods.

In this paper, we exhaustively probe the object hallucination problem from three aspects. First, we examine various state-of-the-art VLP models, showing that models achieving better scores on standard metrics(e.g., BLEU-4, CIDEr) could hallucinate objects more frequently. Second, we investigate how different types of visual features in VLP influence hallucination, including region-based, grid-based, and patch-based. Surprisingly, we find that patch-based features perform the best and smaller patch resolution yields a non-trivial reduction in object hallucination. Third, we decouple various VLP objectives and demonstrate their effectiveness in alleviating object hallucination. Based on that, we propose a new pre-training loss, object masked language modeling, to further reduce object hallucination. We evaluate models on both COCO (in-domain) and NoCaps (out-of-domain) datasets with our improved CHAIR metric. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of various text decoding strategies and image augmentation methods on object hallucination.","No"

Previous works only focus on the scenario where known and novel categories are of the same granularity. In this paper, we investigate a new practical scenario called Fine-grained Category Discovery under Coarse-grained supervision (FCDC). FCDC aims at discovering fine-grained categories with only coarse-grained labeled data, which can adapt models to categories of different granularity from known ones and reduce significant labeling cost. It is also a challenging task since supervised training on coarse-grained categories tends to focus on inter-class distance (distance between coarse-grained classes) but ignore intra-class distance (distance between fine-grained sub-classes) which is essential for separating fine-grained categories. Considering most current methods cannot transfer knowledge from coarse-grained level to fine-grained level, we propose a hierarchical weighted self-contrastive network by building a novel weighted self-contrastive module and combining it with supervised learning in a hierarchical manner.

There is relatively little methods exist that estimate the confidence of prediction models. In this paper, we propose novel methods that, given a neural network classification model, estimate uncertainty of particular predictions generated by this model. Furthermore, we propose a method that, given a model and a confidence level, calculates a threshold that separates prediction generated by this model into two subsets, one of them meets the given confidence level. In contrast to other methods, the proposed methods do not require any changes on existing neural networks, because they simply build on the output logit layer of a common neural network. In particular, the methods infer the confidence of a particular prediction based on the distribution of the logit values corresponding to this prediction. The proposed methods constitute a tool that is recommended for filtering predictions in the process of knowledge extraction, e.g. based on web scrapping, where predictions subsets are identified that maximize the precision on cost of the recall, which is less important due to the availability of data. The method has been tested on different tasks including relation extraction, named entity recognition and image classification to show the significant increase of accuracy achieved.","No"

For example, in task-oriented settings, reinforcement learning that optimizes only task-success can lead to abysmal lexical diversity.

To this end, we propose a new theoretical framework for learning to generate text in dialogue. Compared to existing theories of learning, our framework allows for analysis of the multi-faceted goals inherent to text-generation. We use our framework to develop theoretical guarantees for learners that adapt to unseen data. As an example, we apply our theory to study data-shift within a cooperative learning algorithm proposed for the GuessWhat?! visual dialogue game. From this insight, we propose a new algorithm, and empirically, we demonstrate our proposal improves both task-success and human-likeness of the generated text.

This scheme is usually not strong enough to constrain the generative model due to insufficient information involved. In this paper, we propose a novel method, prompt conditioned VAE for lifelong learning (PCLL), to enhance generative replay by incorporating tasks' statistics. PCLL captures task-specific distributions with a conditional variational autoencoder, conditioned on natural language prompts to guide the pseudo-sample generation. Moreover, it leverages a distillation process to further consolidate past knowledge by alleviating the noise in pseudo samples.

Existing methods to control for story preference utilize prompt engineering which is labor intensive and often inconsistent. They may also use logit-manipulation methods which require annotated datasets to exist for the desired attributes. To address these issues, we first train a contrastive bi-encoder model to align stories with corresponding human critiques, named CARP, building a general purpose preference model. This is subsequently used as a reward function to fine-tune a generative language model via reinforcement learning. However, simply fine-tuning a generative language model with a contrastive reward model does not always reliably result in a story generation system capable of generating stories that meet user preferences. To increase story generation robustness we further fine-tune the contrastive reward model using a prompt-learning technique. A human participant study is then conducted comparing generations from our full system, ablations, and two baselines. We show that the full fine-tuning pipeline results in a story generator preferred over a LLM 20x as large as well as logit-based methods. This motivates the use of contrastive learning for general purpose human preference modeling.","No"

In this work, we introduce a distilling then pruning framework to compress large vision-language models into smaller, faster, and more accurate ones. We first shrink the size of a pre-trained large VLM and apply knowledge distillation in the vision-language pre-training stage to obtain a task-agnostic compact VLM. Then we propose a modal-adaptive pruning algorithm to automatically infer the importance of vision and language modalities for different downstream tasks and adaptively remove redundant structures and neurons in different encoders with controllable target sparsity.

"HashFormers: Towards Vocabulary-independent Pre-trained Transformers","Huiyin Xue and Nikolaos Aletras",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07904","Transformer-based pre-trained language models are vocabulary-dependent, mapping by default each token to its corresponding embedding. This one-to-one mapping results into embedding matrices that occupy a lot of memory (i.e. millions of parameters) and grow linearly with the size of the vocabulary. Previous work on on-device transformers dynamically generate token embeddings on-the-fly without embedding matrices using locality-sensitive hashing over morphological information. These embeddings are subsequently fed into transformer layers for text classification. However, these methods are not pre-trained. Inspired by this line of work, we propose HashFormers, a new family of vocabulary-independent pre-trained transformers that support an unlimited vocabulary (i.e. all possible tokens in a corpus) given a substantially smaller fixed-sized embedding matrix. We achieve this by first introducing computationally cheap hashing functions that bucket together individual tokens to embeddings. We also propose three variants that do not require an embedding matrix at all, further reducing the memory requirements. We empirically demonstrate that HashFormers are more memory efficient compared to standard pre-trained transformers while achieving comparable predictive performance when fine-tuned on multiple text classification tasks. For example, our most efficient HashFormer variant has a negligible performance degradation (0.4\% on GLUE) using only 99.1K parameters for representing the embeddings compared to 12.3-38M parameters of state-of-the-art models.","No"

In this work, we take the first step to investigate the unconcealment of textual poisoned samples at the intermediate-feature level and propose a feature-based efficient online defense method. Through extensive experiments on existing attacking methods, we find that the poisoned samples are far away from clean samples in the intermediate feature space of a poisoned NLP model. Motivated by this observation, we devise a distance-based anomaly score (DAN) to distinguish poisoned samples from clean samples at the feature level. Experiments on sentiment analysis and offense detection tasks demonstrate the superiority of DAN, as it substantially surpasses existing online defense methods in terms of defending performance and enjoys lower inference costs. Moreover, we show that DAN is also resistant to adaptive attacks based on feature-level regularization. Our code is available at https://github.com/lancopku/DAN.","No"
"Style Transfer as Data Augmentation: A Case Study on Named Entity Recognition","Shuguang Chen, Leonardo Neves, Thamar Solorio",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07916","In this work, we take the named entity recognition task in the English language as a case study and explore style transfer as a data augmentation method to increase the size and diversity of training data in low-resource scenarios.

Moreover, we design a constrained decoding algorithm along with a set of key ingredients for data selection to guarantee the generation of valid and coherent data. Experiments and analysis on five different domain pairs under different data regimes demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve results compared to current state-of-the-art data augmentation methods. Our approach is a practical solution to data scarcity, and we expect it to be applicable to other NLP tasks.","No"

The sheer volume of antisemitic and conspiracy theory content on the Internet makes data-driven algorithmic approaches essential for anti-discrimination organizations and researchers alike. However, the manifestation and dissemination of these two interrelated phenomena is still quite under-researched in scholarly empirical research of large text corpora. Algorithmic approaches for the detection and classification of specific contents usually require labeled datasets, annotated based on conceptually sound guidelines. While there is a growing number of datasets for the more general phenomenon of hate speech, the development of corpora and annotation guidelines for antisemitic and conspiracy content is still in its infancy, especially for languages other than English. We contribute to closing this gap by developing an annotation guide for antisemitic and conspiracy theory online content in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide working definitions, including specific forms of antisemitism such as encoded and post-Holocaust antisemitism. We use these to annotate a German-language dataset consisting of ~3,700 Telegram messages sent between 03/2020 and 12/2021.","No"

One challenge is that it requires out-of-domain generalization ability as the source CSKB for training is of a relatively smaller scale (1M) while the whole candidate space for population is way larger (200M). We propose PseudoReasoner, a semi-supervised learning framework for CSKB population that uses a teacher model pre-trained on CSKBs to provide pseudo labels on the unlabeled candidate dataset for a student model to learn from. The teacher can be a generative model rather than restricted to discriminative models as previous works. In addition, we design a new filtering procedure for pseudo labels based on influence function and the student model's prediction to further improve the performance. The framework can improve the backbone model KG-BERT (RoBERTa-large) by 3.3 points on the overall performance and especially, 5.3 points on the out-of-domain performance, and achieves the state-of-the-art.

"Evaluating Out-of-Distribution Performance on Document Image Classifiers","Stefan Larson, Gordon Lim, Yutong Ai, David Kuang, Kevin Leach",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07448","The ability of a document classifier to handle inputs that are drawn from a distribution different from the training distribution is crucial for robust deployment and generalizability.

In this paper, we curate and release a new out-of-distribution benchmark for evaluating out-of-distribution performance for document classifiers. Our new out-of-distribution benchmark consists of two types of documents: those that are not part of any of the 16 in-domain RVL-CDIP categories (RVL-CDIP-O), and those that are one of the 16 in-domain categories yet are drawn from a distribution different from that of the original RVL-CDIP dataset (RVL-CDIP-N). While prior work on document classification for in-domain RVL-CDIP documents reports high accuracy scores, we find that these models exhibit accuracy drops of between roughly 15-30% on our new out-of-domain RVL-CDIP-N benchmark, and further struggle to distinguish between in-domain RVL-CDIP-N and out-of-domain RVL-CDIP-O inputs. Our new benchmark provides researchers with a valuable new resource for analyzing out-of-distribution performance on document classifiers.

Based upon 650 scenes from ScanNet, we provide a dataset centered around 6.8k unique situations, along with 20.4k descriptions and 33.4k diverse reasoning questions for these situations. These questions examine a wide spectrum of reasoning capabilities for an intelligent agent, ranging from spatial relation comprehension to commonsense understanding, navigation, and multi-hop reasoning. SQA3D imposes a significant challenge to current multi-modal especially 3D reasoning models. We evaluate various state-of-the-art approaches and find that the best one only achieves an overall score of 47.20%, while amateur human participants can reach 90.06%. We believe SQA3D could facilitate future embodied AI research with stronger situation understanding and reasoning capability.","No"

With the advent of voice cloning for reading-style speech synthesis, a new voice cloning paradigm for human-like and spontaneous speech synthesis is required. We, therefore, focus on personalized spontaneous speech synthesis that can clone both the individual's voice timbre and speech disfluency. Specifically, we deal with filled pauses, a major source of speech disfluency, which is known to play an important role in speech generation and communication in psychology and linguistics. To comparatively evaluate personalized filled pause insertion and non-personalized filled pause prediction methods, we developed a speech synthesis method with a non-personalized external filled pause predictor trained with a multi-speaker corpus. The results clarify the position-word entanglement of filled pauses, i.e., the necessity of precisely predicting positions for naturalness and the necessity of precisely predicting words for individuality on the evaluation of synthesized speech.","No"

"Learning to Jointly Transcribe and Subtitle for End-to-End Spontaneous Speech Recognition","Jakob Poncelet, Hugo Van hamme",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07771","TV subtitles are a rich source of transcriptions of many types of speech, ranging from read speech in news reports to conversational and spontaneous speech in talk shows and soaps. However, subtitles are not verbatim (i.e. exact) transcriptions of speech, so they cannot be used directly to improve an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model. We propose a multitask dual-decoder Transformer model that jointly performs ASR and automatic subtitling. The ASR decoder (possibly pre-trained) predicts the verbatim output and the subtitle decoder generates a subtitle, while sharing the encoder. The two decoders can be independent or connected. The model is trained to perform both tasks jointly, and is able to effectively use subtitle data. We show improvements on regular ASR and on spontaneous and conversational ASR by incorporating the additional subtitle decoder. The method does not require preprocessing (aligning, filtering, pseudo-labeling, ...) of the subtitles.","No"
"AVLEN: Audio-Visual-Language Embodied Navigation in 3D Environments","Sudipta Paul and Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury and Anoop Cherian",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07940","Recent years have seen embodied visual navigation advance in two distinct directions: (i) in equipping the AI agent to follow natural language instructions, and (ii) in making the navigable world multimodal, e.g., audio-visual navigation. However, the real world is not only multimodal, but also often complex, and thus in spite of these advances, agents still need to understand the uncertainty in their actions and seek instructions to navigate. To this end, we present AVLEN~ -- an interactive agent for Audio-Visual-Language Embodied Navigation. Similar to audio-visual navigation tasks, the goal of our embodied agent is to localize an audio event via navigating the 3D visual world; however, the agent may also seek help from a human (oracle), where the assistance is provided in free-form natural language. To realize these abilities, AVLEN uses a multimodal hierarchical reinforcement learning backbone that learns: (a) high-level policies to choose either audio-cues for navigation or to query the oracle, and (b) lower-level policies to select navigation actions based on its audio-visual and language inputs. The policies are trained via rewarding for the success on the navigation task while minimizing the number of queries to the oracle. To empirically evaluate AVLEN, we present experiments on the SoundSpaces framework for semantic audio-visual navigation tasks. Our results show that equipping the agent to ask for help leads to a clear improvement in performance, especially in challenging cases, e.g., when the sound is unheard during training or in the presence of distractor sounds.","No"

"Disentangled Text Representation Learning with Information-Theoretic Perspective for Adversarial Robustness","Jiahao Zhao, Wenji Mao",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14957","Adversarial vulnerability remains a major obstacle to constructing reliable NLP systems. When imperceptible perturbations are added to raw input text, the performance of a deep learning model may drop dramatically under attacks. Recent work argues the adversarial vulnerability of the model is caused by the non-robust features in supervised training. Thus in this paper, we tackle the adversarial robustness challenge from the view of disentangled representation learning, which is able to explicitly disentangle robust and non-robust features in text. Specifically, inspired by the variation of information (VI) in information theory, we derive a disentangled learning objective composed of mutual information to represent both the semantic representativeness of latent embeddings and differentiation of robust and non-robust features. On the basis of this, we design a disentangled learning network to estimate these mutual information. Experiments on text classification and entailment tasks show that our method significantly outperforms the representative methods under adversarial attacks, indicating that discarding non-robust features is critical for improving adversarial robustness.","No"

To this end, we propose MABEL (a Method for Attenuating Gender Bias using Entailment Labels), an intermediate pre-training approach for mitigating gender bias in contextualized representations. Key to our approach is the use of a contrastive learning objective on counterfactually augmented, gender-balanced entailment pairs from natural language inference (NLI) datasets. We also introduce an alignment regularizer that pulls identical entailment pairs along opposite gender directions closer. We extensively evaluate our approach on intrinsic and extrinsic metrics, and show that MABEL outperforms previous task-agnostic debiasing approaches in terms of fairness. It also preserves task performance after fine-tuning on downstream tasks. Together, these findings demonstrate the suitability of NLI data as an effective means of bias mitigation, as opposed to only using unlabeled sentences in the literature. Finally, we identify that existing approaches often use evaluation settings that are insufficient or inconsistent. We make an effort to reproduce and compare previous methods, and call for unifying the evaluation settings across gender debiasing methods for better future comparison.","No"

However, the most efficient models are not well suited to specialized industries. In these cases, internal data is scarce and expensive to find in all language pairs. Therefore, fine-tuning a mNMT model on a specialized domain is hard. In this context, we decided to focus on a new task: Domain Adaptation of a pre-trained mNMT model on a single pair of language while trying to maintain model quality on generic domain data for all language pairs. The risk of loss on generic domain and on other pairs is high. This task is key for mNMT model adoption in the industry and is at the border of many others. We propose a fine-tuning procedure for the generic mNMT that combines embeddings freezing and adversarial loss. Our experiments demonstrated that the procedure improves performances on specialized data with a minimal loss in initial performances on generic domain for all languages pairs, compared to a naive standard approach (+10.0 BLEU score on specialized data, -0.01 to -0.5 BLEU on WMT and Tatoeba datasets on the other pairs with M2M100).","No"

Vision-and-language end-to-end trained systems exhibit sizeable performance drops across all these tests. Neuro-symbolic methods suffer even more on cross-benchmark transfer from GQA to VQA, but they show smaller accuracy drops on the other generalization tests and their performance quickly improves by few-shot training.

We first introduce arXivEdits, a new annotated corpus of 751 full papers from arXiv with gold sentence alignment across their multiple versions of revision, as well as fine-grained span-level edits and their underlying intentions for 1,000 sentence pairs. It supports our data-driven analysis to unveil the common strategies practiced by researchers for revising their papers.

A neural CRF sentence alignment model trained on our corpus achieves 93.8 F1, enabling the reliable matching of sentences between different versions. We formulate the edit extraction task as a span alignment problem, and our proposed method extracts more fine-grained and explainable edits, compared to the commonly used diff algorithm.

Unlike conventional dialogue generation, the persona-based dialogue needs to consider both dialogue context and persona, posing a challenge for coherent training. Specifically, this requires a delicate weight balance between context and persona. To achieve that, in this paper, we propose an effective framework with Persona-Adaptive Attention (PAA), which adaptively integrates the weights from the persona and context information via our designed attention. In addition, a dynamic masking mechanism is applied to the PAA to not only drop redundant information in context and persona but also serve as a regularization mechanism to avoid overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PAA framework compared to the strong baselines in both automatic and human evaluation. Moreover, the proposed PAA approach can perform equivalently well in a low-resource regime compared to models trained in a full-data setting, which achieve a similar result with only 20% to 30% of data compared to the larger models trained in the full-data setting. To fully exploit the effectiveness of our design, we designed several variants for handling the weighted information in different ways, showing the necessity and sufficiency of our weighting and masking designs.","No"

CD is inspired by the fact that the failures of larger LMs are even more prevalent in smaller LMs, and that this difference signals exactly which texts should be preferred. CD requires zero training, and produces higher quality text than decoding from the larger LM alone.

While conceptual advances alongside modelling and simulation work have attempted to connect speech segmentation and linguistic communication with the FEP, we extend this program to the underlying computations responsible for generating syntactic objects. We argue that recently proposed principles of economy in language design - such as 'minimal search' criteria from theoretical syntax - adhere to the FEP. This affords a greater degree of explanatory power to the FEP - with respect to higher language functions - and offers linguistics a grounding in first principles with respect to computability. We show how both tree-geometric depth and a Kolmogorov complexity estimate (recruiting a Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm) can be used to accurately predict legal operations on syntactic workspaces, directly in line with formulations of variational free energy minimization. This is used to motivate a general principle of language design that we term Turing-Chomsky Compression (TCC). We use TCC to align concerns of linguists with the normative account of self-organization furnished by the FEP, by marshalling evidence from theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics to ground core principles of efficient syntactic computation within active inference.","No"

By noticing the term importance weight can provide valuable information for passage retrieval, we hereby propose alternative retrieval oriented masking (dubbed as ROM) strategy where more important tokens will have a higher probability of being masked out, to capture this straightforward yet essential information to facilitate the language model pre-training process. Notably, the proposed new token masking method will not change the architecture and learning objective of original PTM. Our experiments verify that the proposed ROM enables term importance information to help language model pre-training thus achieving better performance on multiple passage retrieval benchmarks.","No"

We find that masked language models capture societal stigma about gender in mental health: models are consistently more likely to predict female subjects than male in sentences about having a mental health condition (32% vs. 19%), and this disparity is exacerbated for sentences that indicate treatment-seeking behavior. Furthermore, we find that different models capture dimensions of stigma differently for men and women, associating stereotypes like anger, blame, and pity more with women with mental health conditions than with men. In showing the complex nuances of models' gendered mental health stigma, we demonstrate that context and overlapping dimensions of identity are important considerations when assessing computational models' social biases.","No"
"A Curriculum Learning Approach for Multi-domain Text Classification Using Keyword weight Ranking","Zilin Yuan, Yinghui Li, Yangning Li, Rui Xie, Wei Wu, Hai-Tao Zheng",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15147","Text classification is a very classic NLP task, but it has two prominent shortcomings: On the one hand, text classification is deeply domain-dependent. That is, a classifier trained on the corpus of one domain may not perform so well in another domain. On the other hand, text classification models require a lot of annotated data for training. However, for some domains, there may not exist enough annotated data. Therefore, it is valuable to investigate how to efficiently utilize text data from different domains to improve the performance of models in various domains. Some multi-domain text classification models are trained by adversarial training to extract shared features among all domains and the specific features of each domain. We noted that the distinctness of the domain-specific features is different, so in this paper, we propose to use a curriculum learning strategy based on keyword weight ranking to improve the performance of multi-domain text classification models. The experimental results on the Amazon review and FDU-MTL datasets show that our curriculum learning strategy effectively improves the performance of multi-domain text classification models based on adversarial learning and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","No"
"Dictionary-Assisted Supervised Contrastive Learning","Patrick Y. Wu, Richard Bonneau, Joshua A. Tucker, Jonathan Nagler",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15172","Text analysis in the social sciences often involves using specialized dictionaries to reason with abstract concepts, such as perceptions about the economy or abuse on social media. These dictionaries allow researchers to impart domain knowledge and note subtle usages of words relating to a concept(s) of interest. We introduce the dictionary-assisted supervised contrastive learning (DASCL) objective, allowing researchers to leverage specialized dictionaries when fine-tuning pretrained language models. The text is first keyword simplified: a common, fixed token replaces any word in the corpus that appears in the dictionary(ies) relevant to the concept of interest. During fine-tuning, a supervised contrastive objective draws closer the embeddings of the original and keyword-simplified texts of the same class while pushing further apart the embeddings of different classes. The keyword-simplified texts of the same class are more textually similar than their original text counterparts, which additionally draws the embeddings of the same class closer together. Combining DASCL and cross-entropy improves classification performance metrics in few-shot learning settings and social science applications compared to using cross-entropy alone and alternative contrastive and data augmentation methods.","No"
"Disentangled and Robust Representation Learning for Bragging Classification in Social Media","Xiang Li, Yucheng Zhou",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15180","Researching bragging behavior on social media arouses interest of computational (socio) linguists. However, existing bragging classification datasets suffer from a serious data imbalance issue. Because labeling a data-balance dataset is expensive, most methods introduce external knowledge to improve model learning. Nevertheless, such methods inevitably introduce noise and non-relevance information from external knowledge. To overcome the drawback, we propose a novel bragging classification method with disentangle-based representation augmentation and domain-aware adversarial strategy. Specifically, model learns to disentangle and reconstruct representation and generate augmented features via disentangle-based representation augmentation. Moreover, domain-aware adversarial strategy aims to constrain domain of augmented features to improve their robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.","No"

However, this performance comes at the cost of significantly bloated models which are not practically deployable. Knowledge Distillation is one popular technique to develop competitive, lightweight models: In this work, we first evaluate its use to compress MT models focusing on languages with extremely limited training data. Through our analysis across 8 languages, we find that the variance in the performance of the distilled models due to their dependence on priors including the amount of synthetic data used for distillation, the student architecture, training hyperparameters and confidence of the teacher models, makes distillation a brittle compression mechanism. To mitigate this, we explore the use of post-training quantization for the compression of these models. Here, we find that while distillation provides gains across some low-resource languages, quantization provides more consistent performance trends for the entire range of languages, especially the lowest-resource languages in our target set.","No"
"Truncation Sampling as Language Model Desmoothing","John Hewitt, Christopher D. Manning, Percy Liang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15191","Long samples of text from neural language models can be of poor quality. Truncation sampling algorithms--like top-$p$ or top-$k$ -- address this by setting some words' probabilities to zero at each step. This work provides framing for the aim of truncation, and an improved algorithm for that aim. We propose thinking of a neural language model as a mixture of a true distribution and a smoothing distribution that avoids infinite perplexity. In this light, truncation algorithms aim to perform desmoothing, estimating a subset of the support of the true distribution. Finding a good subset is crucial: we show that top-$p$ unnecessarily truncates high-probability words, for example causing it to truncate all words but Trump for a document that starts with Donald. We introduce $\eta$-sampling, which truncates words below an entropy-dependent probability threshold. Compared to previous algorithms, $\eta$-sampling generates more plausible long English documents according to humans, is better at breaking out of repetition, and behaves more reasonably on a battery of test distributions.","No"

"Parsing linearizations appreciate PoS tags - but some are fussy about errors","Alberto Mu\~noz-Ortiz, Mark Anderson, David Vilares, Carlos G\'omez-Rodr\'iguez",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15219","PoS tags, once taken for granted as a useful resource for syntactic parsing, have become more situational with the popularization of deep learning. Recent work on the impact of PoS tags on graph- and transition-based parsers suggests that they are only useful when tagging accuracy is prohibitively high, or in low-resource scenarios. However, such an analysis is lacking for the emerging sequence labeling parsing paradigm, where it is especially relevant as some models explicitly use PoS tags for encoding and decoding. We undertake a study and uncover some trends. Among them, PoS tags are generally more useful for sequence labeling parsers than for other paradigms, but the impact of their accuracy is highly encoding-dependent, with the PoS-based head-selection encoding being best only when both tagging accuracy and resource availability are high.","No"

Despite phenomenal progress on general adversarial attacks, few works have investigated the vulnerability and attack specifically for QA models. In this work, we first explore the biases in the existing models and discover that they mainly rely on keyword matching between the question and context, and ignore the relevant contextual relations for answer prediction. Based on two biases above, TASA attacks the target model in two folds: (1) lowering the model's confidence on the gold answer with a perturbed answer sentence; (2) misguiding the model towards a wrong answer with a distracting answer sentence. Equipped with designed beam search and filtering methods, TASA can generate more effective attacks than existing textual attack methods while sustaining the quality of contexts, in extensive experiments on five QA datasets and human evaluations.","No"

In this work, we propose a self-supervised domain adaptation method, based upon an iterative pseudo-forced alignment algorithm. The produced alignments are employed to customize an end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and iteratively refined. The algorithm is fed with frame-wise character posteriors produced by a seed ASR, trained with out-of-domain data, and optimized throughout a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. The alignments are computed iteratively upon a corpus of broadcast TV. The process is repeated by reducing the quantity of text to be aligned or expanding the alignment window until finding the best possible audio-text alignment. The starting timestamps, or temporal anchors, are produced uniquely based on the confidence score of the last aligned utterance. This score is computed with the paths of the CTC-alignment matrix. With this methodology, no human-revised text references are required. Alignments from long audio files with low-quality transcriptions, like TV captions, are filtered out by confidence score and ready for further ASR adaptation. The obtained results, on both the Spanish RTVE2022 and CommonVoice databases, underpin the feasibility of using CTC-based systems to perform: highly accurate audio-text alignments, domain adaptation and semi-supervised training of end-to-end ASR.","No"

We apply BABERT for feature induction of Chinese sequence labeling tasks. Experimental results on ten benchmarks of Chinese sequence labeling demonstrate that BABERT can provide consistent improvements on all datasets.

"Can language models handle recursively nested grammatical structures? A case study on comparing models and humans","Andrew Kyle Lampinen",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15303","How should we compare the capabilities of language models and humans? Here, I consider a case study: processing of recursively nested grammatical structures. Prior work has suggested that language models cannot handle these structures as reliably as humans can. However, the humans were provided with instructions and training before being evaluated, while the language models were evaluated zero-shot. I therefore attempt to more closely match the evaluation paradigms by providing language models with few-shot prompts. A simple prompt, which contains substantially less content than the human training, allows large language models to consistently outperform the human results. The same prompt even allows extrapolation to more-deeply-nested conditions than have been tested in humans. Further, a reanalysis of the prior human experiments suggests that the humans may not perform above chance at the difficult structures initially. These results suggest that large language models can in fact process recursively nested grammatical structures comparably to humans. This case study highlights how discrepancies in the quantity of experiment-specific context can confound comparisons of language models and humans. I use this case study to reflect on the broader challenge of comparing human and model capabilities, and to suggest that there is an important difference between evaluating cognitive models of a specific phenomenon and evaluating broadly-trained models.","No"

Trivial approaches such as combining pre-trained word or sentence embeddings and encoding through pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been shown to be feasible for this task. However, these approaches typically ignore the conversational interactions between interlocutors, resulting in poor performance. To address this issue, we proposed a self-guided contrastive learning approach named dial2vec. Dial2vec considers a dialogue as an information exchange process. It captures the conversational interaction patterns between interlocutors and leverages them to guide the learning of the embeddings corresponding to each interlocutor. The dialogue embedding is obtained by an aggregation of the embeddings from all interlocutors. To verify our approach, we establish a comprehensive benchmark consisting of six widely-used dialogue datasets. We consider three evaluation tasks: domain categorization, semantic relatedness, and dialogue retrieval. Dial2vec achieves on average 8.7, 9.0, and 13.8 points absolute improvements in terms of purity, Spearman's correlation, and mean average precision (MAP) over the strongest baseline on the three tasks respectively. Further analysis shows that dial2vec obtains informative and discriminative embeddings for both interlocutors under the guidance of the conversational interactions and achieves the best performance when aggregating them through the interlocutor-level pooling strategy.

However, storing and accessing these embeddings requires a large amount of space. This is not conducive to the deployment of these models on resource-limited devices. Combining the powerful compression capability of tensor products, we propose a word embedding compression method with morphological augmentation, Morphologically-enhanced Tensorized Embeddings (MorphTE). A word consists of one or more morphemes, the smallest units that bear meaning or have a grammatical function. MorphTE represents a word embedding as an entangled form of its morpheme vectors via the tensor product, which injects prior semantic and grammatical knowledge into the learning of embeddings. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the morpheme vector and the number of morphemes are much smaller than those of words, which greatly reduces the parameters of the word embeddings. We conduct experiments on tasks such as machine translation and question answering. Experimental results on four translation datasets of different languages show that MorphTE can compress word embedding parameters by about 20 times without performance loss and significantly outperforms related embedding compression methods.","No"

"Arithmetic Sampling: Parallel Diverse Decoding for Large Language Models","Luke Vilnis, Yury Zemlyanskiy, Patrick Murray, Alexandre Passos, Sumit Sanghai",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15458","Decoding methods for large language models often trade-off between diversity of outputs and parallelism of computation. Methods such as beam search and Gumbel top-k sampling can guarantee a different output for each element of the beam, but are not easy to parallelize. Alternatively, methods such as temperature sampling and its modifications (top-k sampling, nucleus sampling, typical decoding, and others), are embarrassingly parallel, but have no guarantees about duplicate samples. We present a framework for sampling according to an arithmetic code book implicitly defined by a large language model, compatible with common sampling variations, with provable beam diversity under certain conditions, as well as being embarrassingly parallel and providing unbiased and consistent expectations from the original model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on WMT machine translation, showing substantially reduced variance when estimating expected BLEU score and up to 1 point increased BLEU in oracle experiments.","No"

Recent advances still struggle to train a separate model for each language pair, which is costly and unaffordable when the number of languages increases in the real world. In other words, the multilingual multimodal machine translation (Multilingual MMT) task has not been investigated, which aims to handle the aforementioned issues by providing a shared semantic space for multiple languages. Besides, the image modality has no language boundaries, which is superior to bridging the semantic gap between languages. To this end, we first propose the Multilingual MMT task by establishing two new Multilingual MMT benchmark datasets covering seven languages. Then, an effective baseline LVP-M3 using visual prompts is proposed to support translations between different languages, which includes three stages (token encoding, language-aware visual prompt generation, and language translation). Extensive experimental results on our constructed benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LVP-M3 method for Multilingual MMT.","No"

However, due to historical, social, or behavioral reasons, there may exist bias that associates certain linguistic quality of user written text with the users' protected attributes such as gender, race, etc. The generators can identify and inherit these correlations and generate texts discriminately w.r.t. the users' protected attributes. Without proper intervention, such bias can adversarially influence the users' trust and reliance on the system. From a broader perspective, bias in auto-generated contents can reinforce the social stereotypes about how online users write through interactions with the users. In this work, we investigate the fairness of personalized text generation in the setting of explainable recommendation. We develop a general framework for achieving measure-specific counterfactual fairness on the linguistic quality of personalized explanations. We propose learning disentangled representations for counterfactual inference and develop a novel policy learning algorithm with carefully designed rewards for fairness optimization.

For resource-constrained devices, there is an urgent need for a spatially and temporally efficient model which retains the major capacity of PLMs. However, existing statically compressed models are unaware of the diverse complexities between input instances, potentially resulting in redundancy and inadequacy for simple and complex inputs. Also, miniature models with early exiting encounter challenges in the trade-off between making predictions and serving the deeper layers. Motivated by such considerations, we propose a collaborative optimization for PLMs that integrates static model compression and dynamic inference acceleration. Specifically, the PLM is slenderized in width while the depth remains intact, complementing layer-wise early exiting to speed up inference dynamically. To address the trade-off of early exiting, we propose a joint training approach that calibrates slenderization and preserves contributive structures to each exit instead of only the final layer. Experiments are conducted on GLUE benchmark and the results verify the Pareto optimality of our approach at high compression and acceleration rate with 1/8 parameters and 1/19 FLOPs of BERT.","No"

In this work, we intend to close the loop by leveraging the recent advances in summarization metrics to create quality-aware abstractive summarizers.

We experiment using several metrics to train our energy-based re-ranker and show that it consistently improves the scores achieved by the predicted summaries. Nonetheless, human evaluation results show that the re-ranking approach should be used with care for highly abstractive summaries, as the available metrics are not yet sufficiently reliable for this purpose.","No"

"Cross-Domain Neural Entity Linking","Hassan Soliman",9,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15616","Entity Linking is the task of matching a mention to an entity in a given knowledge base (KB). It contributes to annotating a massive amount of documents existing on the Web to harness new facts about their matched entities. However, existing Entity Linking systems focus on developing models that are typically domain-dependent and robust only to a particular knowledge base on which they have been trained. The performance is not as adequate when being evaluated on documents and knowledge bases from different domains. Approaches based on pre-trained language models, such as Wu et al. (2020), attempt to solve the problem using a zero-shot setup, illustrating some potential when evaluated on a general-domain KB. Nevertheless, the performance is not equivalent when evaluated on a domain-specific KB. To allow for more accurate Entity Linking across different domains, we propose our framework: Cross-Domain Neural Entity Linking (CDNEL). Our objective is to have a single system that enables simultaneous linking to both the general-domain KB and the domain-specific KB. CDNEL works by learning a joint representation space for these knowledge bases from different domains. It is evaluated using the external Entity Linking dataset (Zeshel) constructed by Logeswaran et al. (2019) and the Reddit dataset collected by Botzer et al. (2021), to compare our proposed method with the state-of-the-art results. The proposed framework uses different types of datasets for fine-tuning, resulting in different model variants of CDNEL.

Major AI companies with expensive infrastructures are able to develop and train these large models with billions and millions of parameters from scratch. Third parties, researchers, and practitioners are increasingly adopting these pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on their private data to accomplish their downstream AI tasks. However, it has been shown that an adversary can extract/reconstruct the exact training samples from these LLMs, which can lead to revealing personally identifiable information. The issue has raised deep concerns about the privacy of LLMs. Differential privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework that allows adding noise in the process of training or fine-tuning LLMs such that extracting the training data becomes infeasible (i.e., with a cryptographically small success probability). While the theoretical privacy guarantees offered in most extant studies assume learning models from scratch through many training iterations in an asymptotic setting, this assumption does not hold in fine-tuning scenarios in which the number of training iterations is significantly smaller. To address the gap, we present \ewtune, a DP framework for fine-tuning LLMs based on Edgeworth accountant with finite-sample privacy guarantees. Our results across four well-established natural language understanding (NLU) tasks show that while \ewtune~adds privacy guarantees to LLM fine-tuning process, it directly contributes to decreasing the induced noise to up to 5.6\% and improves the state-of-the-art LLMs performance by up to 1.1\% across all NLU tasks.

Humans, however, produce speech by controlling articulators, which results in the production of speech sounds through physical properties of sound propagation. We propose a new unsupervised generative model of speech production/synthesis that includes articulatory representations and thus more closely mimics human speech production. We introduce the Articulatory Generator to the Generative Adversarial Network paradigm. The Articulatory Generator needs to learn to generate articulatory representations (electromagnetic articulography or EMA) in a fully unsupervised manner without ever accessing EMA data. A separate pre-trained physical model (ema2wav) then transforms the generated EMA representations to speech waveforms, which get sent to the Discriminator for evaluation. Articulatory analysis of the generated EMA representations suggests that the network learns to control articulators in a manner that closely follows human articulators during speech production. Acoustic analysis of the outputs suggest that the network learns to generate words that are part of training data as well as novel innovative words that are absent from training data. Our proposed architecture thus allows modeling of articulatory learning with deep neural networks from raw audio inputs in a fully unsupervised manner.

Furthermore, electronic music instruments, such as modular synthesizers, have near-infinite possibilities for sound creation and can be combined to create unique and complex audio paths. The process of discovering interesting sounds is often serendipitous and impossible to replicate. For this reason, many musicians in electronic genres record audio output at all times while they work in the studio. Subsequently, it is difficult for artists to rediscover audio segments that might be suitable for use in their compositions from thousands of hours of recordings. In this paper, we describe LyricJam Sonic -- a novel creative tool for musicians to rediscover their previous recordings, re-contextualize them with other recordings, and create original live music compositions in real-time. A bi-modal AI-driven approach uses generated lyric lines to find matching audio clips from the artist's past studio recordings, and uses them to generate new lyric lines, which in turn are used to find other clips, thus creating a continuous and evolving stream of music and lyrics. The intent is to keep the artists in a state of creative flow conducive to music creation rather than taking them into an analytical/critical state of deliberately searching for past audio segments. The system can run in either a fully autonomous mode without user input, or in a live performance mode, where the artist plays live music, while the system 'listens' and creates a continuous stream of music and lyrics in response.","No"

We approach the given task of event causality detection by proposing a self-training pipeline that follows a teacher-student classifier method. More specifically, we initially train a teacher model on the true, original task data, and use that teacher model to self-label data to be used in the training of a separate student model for the final task prediction. We test how restricting the number of positive or negative self-labeled examples in the self-training process affects classification performance. Our final results show that using self-training produces a comprehensive performance improvement across all models and self-labeled training sets tested within the task of event causality sequence classification. On top of that, we find that self-training performance did not diminish even when restricting either positive/negative examples used in training.

"Intriguing Properties of Compression on Multilingual Models","Kelechi Ogueji, Orevaoghene Ahia, Gbemileke Onilude, Sebastian Gehrmann, Sara Hooker and Julia Kreutzer",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02738","Multilingual models are often particularly dependent on scaling to generalize to a growing number of languages. Compression techniques are widely relied upon to reconcile the growth in model size with real world resource constraints, but compression can have a disparate effect on model performance for low-resource languages. It is thus crucial to understand the trade-offs between scale, multilingualism, and compression. In this work, we propose an experimental framework to characterize the impact of sparsifying multilingual pre-trained language models during fine-tuning. Applying this framework to mBERT named entity recognition models across 40 languages, we find that compression confers several intriguing and previously unknown generalization properties. In contrast to prior findings, we find that compression may improve model robustness over dense models. We additionally observe that under certain sparsification regimes compression may aid, rather than disproportionately impact the performance of low-resource languages.","No"
"KGLM: Integrating Knowledge Graph Structure in Language Models for Link Prediction","Jason Youn and Ilias Tagkopoulos",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02744","The ability of knowledge graphs to represent complex relationships at scale has led to their adoption for various needs including knowledge representation, question-answering, fraud detection, and recommendation systems. Knowledge graphs are often incomplete in the information they represent, necessitating the need for knowledge graph completion tasks, such as link and relation prediction. Pre-trained and fine-tuned language models have shown promise in these tasks although these models ignore the intrinsic information encoded in the knowledge graph, namely the entity and relation types. In this work, we propose the Knowledge Graph Language Model (KGLM) architecture, where we introduce a new entity/relation embedding layer that learns to differentiate distinctive entity and relation types, therefore allowing the model to learn the structure of the knowledge graph. In this work, we show that further pre-training the language models with this additional embedding layer using the triples extracted from the knowledge graph, followed by the standard fine-tuning phase sets a new state-of-the-art performance for the link prediction task on the benchmark datasets.","No"

To enable multilingual text generation in LAMASSU, we conduct a systematic comparison between specified and unified prediction and joint networks. We leverage a language-agnostic multilingual encoder that substantially outperforms shared encoders. To enhance LAMASSU, we propose to feed target LID to encoders. We also apply connectionist temporal classification regularization to transducer training.

With the large number of topics being available in recent years, it has become necessary to arrange them in a hierarchy. Therefore, the automatic classification systems need to be able to classify the documents hierarchically. In addition, each paper is often assigned to more than one relevant topic. For example, a paper can be assigned to several topics in a hierarchy tree. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset for hierarchical multi-label text classification (HMLTC) of scientific papers called SciHTC, which contains 186,160 papers and 1,233 categories from the ACM CCS tree. We establish strong baselines for HMLTC and propose a multi-task learning approach for topic classification with keyword labeling as an auxiliary task.

"PASTA: Table-Operations Aware Fact Verification via Sentence-Table Cloze Pre-training","Zihui Gu, Ju Fan, Nan Tang, Preslav Nakov, Xiaoman Zhao, Xiaoyong Du",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02816","Fact verification has attracted a lot of research attention recently, e.g., in journalism, marketing, and policymaking, as misinformation and disinformation online can sway one's opinion and affect one's actions. While fact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be easily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information. Hence, table-based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and growing research area. Yet, progress has been limited due to the lack of datasets that can be used to pre-train language models (LMs) to be aware of common table operations, such as aggregating a column or comparing tuples. To bridge this gap, in this paper we introduce PASTA, a novel state-of-the-art framework for table-based fact verification via pre-training with synthesized sentence-table cloze questions. In particular, we design six types of common sentence-table cloze tasks, including Filter, Aggregation, Superlative, Comparative, Ordinal, and Unique, based on which we synthesize a large corpus consisting of 1.2 million sentence-table pairs from WikiTables. PASTA uses a recent pre-trained LM, DeBERTaV3, and further pretrains it on our corpus. Our experimental results show that PASTA achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two table-based fact verification benchmarks: TabFact and SEM-TAB-FACTS. In particular, on the complex set of TabFact, which contains multiple operations, PASTA largely outperforms the previous state of the art by 4.7 points (85.6% vs. 80.9%), and the gap between PASTA and human performance on the small TabFact test set is narrowed to just 1.5 points (90.6% vs. 92.1%).","No"

Embedding-based entity alignment techniques have been drawing a lot of attention recently because they can help solve the issue of symbolic heterogeneity in different KGs. However, in this paper, we show that the progress made in the past was due to biased and unchallenging evaluation. We highlight two major flaws in existing datasets that favor embedding-based entity alignment techniques, i.e., the isomorphic graph structures in relation triples and the weak heterogeneity in attribute triples. Towards a critical evaluation of embedding-based entity alignment methods, we construct a new dataset with heterogeneous relations and attributes based on event-centric KGs. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate existing popular methods, and find that they fail to achieve promising performance. As a new approach to this difficult problem, we propose a time-aware literal encoder for entity alignment. The dataset and source code are publicly available to foster future research.

However, existing conversational recommendation systems (CRS) ignore the advantage of user interest shift in connecting recommendation and conversation, which leads to an ineffective loose coupling structure of CRS. To address this issue, by modeling the recommendation actions as recommendation paths in a knowledge graph (KG), we propose DICR (Dual Imitation for Conversational Recommendation), which designs a dual imitation to explicitly align the recommendation paths and user interest shift paths in a recommendation module and a conversation module, respectively. By exchanging alignment signals, DICR achieves bidirectional promotion between recommendation and conversation modules and generates high-quality responses with accurate recommendations and coherent explanations. Experiments demonstrate that DICR outperforms the state-of-the-art models on recommendation and conversation performance with automatic, human, and novel explainability metrics.","No"

However, regional bias in language models (LMs), a long-standing global discrimination problem, still remains unexplored. This paper bridges the gap by analysing the regional bias learned by the pre-trained language models that are broadly used in NLP tasks. In addition to verifying the existence of regional bias in LMs, we find that the biases on regional groups can be strongly influenced by the geographical clustering of the groups. We accordingly propose a HiErarchical Regional Bias evaluation method (HERB) utilising the information from the sub-region clusters to quantify the bias in pre-trained LMs. Experiments show that our hierarchical metric can effectively evaluate the regional bias with respect to comprehensive topics and measure the potential regional bias that can be propagated to downstream tasks.

"Tri-Attention: Explicit Context-Aware Attention Mechanism for Natural Language Processing","Rui Yu, Yifeng Li, Wenpeng Lu, Longbing Cao",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02899","In natural language processing (NLP), the context of a word or sentence plays an essential role. Contextual information such as the semantic representation of a passage or historical dialogue forms an essential part of a conversation and a precise understanding of the present phrase or sentence. However, the standard attention mechanisms typically generate weights using query and key but ignore context, forming a Bi-Attention framework, despite their great success in modeling sequence alignment. This Bi-Attention mechanism does not explicitly model the interactions between the contexts, queries and keys of target sequences, missing important contextual information and resulting in poor attention performance. Accordingly, a novel and general triple-attention (Tri-Attention) framework expands the standard Bi-Attention mechanism and explicitly interacts query, key, and context by incorporating context as the third dimension in calculating relevance scores. Four variants of Tri-Attention are generated by expanding the two-dimensional vector-based additive, dot-product, scaled dot-product, and bilinear operations in Bi-Attention to the tensor operations for Tri-Attention. Extensive experiments on three NLP tasks demonstrate that Tri-Attention outperforms about 30 state-of-the-art non-attention, standard Bi-Attention, contextual Bi-Attention approaches and pretrained neural language models1.","No"

Although deep learning models have shown promising performance for NLI in recent years, they rely on large scale expensive human-annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a popular technique for reducing the reliance on human annotation by leveraging unlabeled data for training. However, despite its substantial success on single sentence classification tasks where the challenge in making use of unlabeled data is to assign 'good enough' pseudo-labels, for NLI tasks, the nature of unlabeled data is more complex: one of the sentences in the pair (usually the hypothesis) along with the class label are missing from the data and require human annotations, which makes SSL for NLI more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel way to incorporate unlabeled data in SSL for NLI where we use a conditional language model, BART to generate the hypotheses for the unlabeled sentences (used as premises). Our experiments show that our SSL framework successfully exploits unlabeled data and substantially improves the performance of four NLI datasets in low-resource settings.

On the other hand, the accuracy of supervised machine learning models is strongly related to the quality of the labelled data on which they train, and automatic sentiment labelling techniques could reduce the time and cost of human labelling. We have compared three automatic sentiment labelling techniques: TextBlob, Vader, and Afinn to assign sentiments to tweets without any human assistance. We compare three scenarios: one uses training and testing datasets with existing ground truth labels; the second experiment uses automatic labels as training and testing datasets; and the third experiment uses three automatic labelling techniques to label the training dataset and uses the ground truth labels for testing. The experiments were evaluated on two Twitter datasets: SemEval-2013 (DS-1) and SemEval-2016 (DS-2). Results show that the Afinn labelling technique obtains the highest accuracy of 80.17% (DS-1) and 80.05% (DS-2) using a BiLSTM deep learning model. These findings imply that automatic text labelling could provide significant benefits, and suggest a feasible alternative to the time and cost of human labelling efforts.","No"

To address this problem, we propose a novel method based on learning binary weight masks to identify robust tickets hidden in the original PLMs. Since the loss is not differentiable for the binary mask, we assign the hard concrete distribution to the masks and encourage their sparsity using a smoothing approximation of L0 regularization.Furthermore, we design an adversarial loss objective to guide the search for robust tickets and ensure that the tickets perform well bothin accuracy and robustness.

This work proposes a simple yet efficient unsupervised paradigm that connects speech and textual pre-trained models, resulting in an unsupervised speech-to-semantic pre-trained model for various tasks in SLU. To be specific, we propose to use unsupervised automatic speech recognition (ASR) as a connector that bridges different modalities used in speech and textual pre-trained models.

To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-based Text Entailment (PTE) for low-resource named entity recognition, which better leverages knowledge in the PLMs. We first reformulate named entity recognition as the text entailment task. The original sentence with entity type-specific prompts is fed into PLMs to get entailment scores for each candidate. The entity type with the top score is then selected as final label. Then, we inject tagging labels into prompts and treat words as basic units instead of n-gram spans to reduce time complexity in generating candidates by n-grams enumeration. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method PTE achieves competitive performance on the CoNLL03 dataset, and better than fine-tuned counterparts on the MIT Movie and Few-NERD dataset in low-resource settings.","No"

However, little is known about if model explanations can help confidence calibration. Intuitively, humans look at important features attributions and decide whether the model is trustworthy. Similarly, the explanations can tell us when the model may or may not know. Inspired by this, we propose a method named CME that leverages model explanations to make the model less confident with non-inductive attributions. The idea is that when the model is not highly confident, it is difficult to identify strong indications of any class, and the tokens accordingly do not have high attribution scores for any class and vice versa. We conduct extensive experiments on six datasets with two popular pre-trained language models in the in-domain and out-of-domain settings. The results show that CME improves calibration performance in all settings. The expected calibration errors are further reduced when combined with temperature scaling.

Despite their promising performance, most existing few-shot approaches that only learn from the small training set still underperform fully supervised training by nontrivial margins. In this work, we study few-shot learning with PLMs from a different perspective: We first tune an autoregressive PLM on the few-shot samples and then use it as a generator to synthesize a large amount of novel training samples which augment the original training set. To encourage the generator to produce label-discriminative samples, we train it via weighted maximum likelihood where the weight of each token is automatically adjusted based on a discriminative meta-learning objective. A classification PLM can then be fine-tuned on both the few-shot and the synthetic samples with regularization for better generalization and stability.

However, we discover the fact that the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model makes judgment predictions according to wrong (or non-casual) information, which not only weakens the model's generalization capability but also results in severe social problems like discrimination. Here, we analyze the causal mechanism misleading the LJP model to learn the spurious correlations, and then propose a framework to guide the model to learn the underlying causality knowledge in the legal texts.

An example application would be to overcome vaccine hesitancy in combating the coronavirus pandemic. However, existing stance detection strategies rely merely on the individual instances which cannot always capture the expressed stance of a given target. In response, we address a new task called conversational stance detection which is to infer the stance towards a given target (e.g., COVID-19 vaccination) when given a data instance and its corresponding conversation thread. To tackle the task, we first propose a benchmarking conversational stance detection (CSD) dataset with annotations of stances and the structures of conversation threads among the instances based on six major social media platforms in Hong Kong. To infer the desired stances from both data instances and conversation threads, we propose a model called Branch-BERT that incorporates contextual information in conversation threads. Extensive experiments on our CSD dataset show that our proposed model outperforms all the baseline models that do not make use of contextual information. Specifically, it improves the F1 score by 10.3% compared with the state-of-the-art method in the SemEval-2016 Task 6 competition. This shows the potential of incorporating rich contextual information on detecting target-specific stances on social media platforms and implies a more practical way to construct future stance detection tasks.","No"

These PLMs have brought significant performance gains for a range of NLP tasks, circumventing the need to customize complex designs for specific tasks. However, most current work focus on finetuning PLMs on a domain-specific datasets, ignoring the fact that the domain gap can lead to overfitting and even performance drop. Therefore, it is practically important to find an appropriate method to effectively adapt PLMs to a target domain of interest. Recently, a range of methods have been proposed to achieve this purpose. Early surveys on domain adaptation are not suitable for PLMs due to the sophisticated behavior exhibited by PLMs from traditional models trained from scratch and that domain adaptation of PLMs need to be redesigned to take effect. This paper aims to provide a survey on these newly proposed methods and shed light in how to apply traditional machine learning methods to newly evolved and future technologies. By examining the issues of deploying PLMs for downstream tasks, we propose a taxonomy of domain adaptation approaches from a machine learning system view, covering methods for input augmentation, model optimization and personalization. We discuss and compare those methods and suggest promising future research directions.","No"

A deliberation network consists of multiple standard sequence-to-sequence models, each one conditioned on the initial input and the output of the previous model. During training, there are several key questions: whether to apply Monte Carlo approximation to the gradients or the loss, whether to train the standard models jointly or separately, whether to run an intermediate model in teacher forcing or free running mode, whether to apply task-specific techniques. Previous work on deliberation networks typically explores one or two training options for a specific task. This work introduces a unifying framework, covering various training options, and addresses the above questions. In general, it is simpler to approximate the gradients. When parallel training is essential, separate training should be adopted. Regardless of the task, the intermediate model should be in free running mode.

For example, analysis of a legal case summarization dataset demonstrates that sentences serving different types of argumentative roles in the decision appear in different sections of the document. In this work, we propose an unsupervised graph-based ranking model that uses a reweighting algorithm to exploit properties of the document structure of legal case decisions. We also explore the impact of using different methods to compute the document structure. Results on the Canadian Legal Case Law dataset show that our proposed method outperforms several strong baselines.","No"
"Parallel Attention Forcing for Machine Translation","Qingyun Dou and Mark Gales",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03237","Attention-based autoregressive models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various sequence-to-sequence tasks, including Text-To-Speech (TTS) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT), but can be difficult to train. The standard training approach, teacher forcing, guides a model with the reference back-history. During inference, the generated back-history must be used. This mismatch limits the evaluation performance. Attention forcing has been introduced to address the mismatch, guiding the model with the generated back-history and reference attention. While successful in tasks with continuous outputs like TTS, attention forcing faces additional challenges in tasks with discrete outputs like NMT. This paper introduces the two extensions of attention forcing to tackle these challenges. (1) Scheduled attention forcing automatically turns attention forcing on and off, which is essential for tasks with discrete outputs. (2) Parallel attention forcing makes training parallel, and is applicable to Transformer-based models. The experiments show that the proposed approaches improve the performance of models based on RNNs and Transformers.","No"
"Zero-Shot Classification by Logical Reasoning on Natural Language Explanations","Chi Han, Hengzhi Pei, Xinya Du, Heng Ji",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03252","Humans can classify an unseen category by reasoning on its language explanations. This ability is owing to the compositional nature of language: we can combine previously seen concepts to describe the new category. For example, we might describe mavens as 'a kind of large birds with black feathers', so that others can use their knowledge of concepts 'large birds' and 'black feathers' to recognize a maven. Inspired by this observation, in this work we tackle zero-shot classification task by logically parsing and reasoning on natural language explanations. To this end, we propose the framework CLORE (Classification by LOgical Reasoning on Explanations). While previous methods usually regard textual information as implicit features, CLORE parses the explanations into logical structure the and then reasons along this structure on the input to produce a classification score. Experimental results on explanation-based zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that CLORE is superior to baselines, mainly because it performs better on tasks requiring more logical reasoning. Alongside classification decisions, CLORE can provide the logical parsing and reasoning process as a form of rationale. Through empirical analysis we demonstrate that CLORE is also less affected by linguistic biases than baselines.","No"

However, pre-training these large multilingual language models requires a lot of training data, which is not available for African Languages. Active learning is a semi-supervised learning algorithm, in which a model consistently and dynamically learns to identify the most beneficial samples to train itself on, in order to achieve better optimization and performance on downstream tasks. Furthermore, active learning effectively and practically addresses real-world data scarcity. Despite all its benefits, active learning, in the context of NLP and especially multilingual language models pretraining, has received little consideration. In this paper, we present AfroLM, a multilingual language model pretrained from scratch on 23 African languages (the largest effort to date) using our novel self-active learning framework. Pretrained on a dataset significantly (14x) smaller than existing baselines, AfroLM outperforms many multilingual pretrained language models (AfriBERTa, XLMR-base, mBERT) on various NLP downstream tasks (NER, text classification, and sentiment analysis).

Our experiments based on nine benchmark datasets show the superiority of our method over the counterpart models and are comparable to the state-of-the-art methods. In addition to the model enhancement, our work also provides an analytical viewpoint for addressing the general problems in few-shot name entity recognition or other tasks that rely on pre-trained models or prototypical neural networks.","No"

In this paper, we propose a novel Seq2Seq model called CLH3G (Contrastive Learning enhanced Historical Headlines based Headline Generation) which can use the historical headlines of the articles that the author wrote in the past to improve the headline generation of current articles. By taking historical headlines into account, we can integrate the stylistic features of the author into our model, and generate a headline not only appropriate for the article, but also consistent with the author's style. In order to efficiently learn the stylistic features of the author, we further introduce a contrastive learning based auxiliary task for the encoder of our model. Besides, we propose two methods to use the learned stylistic features to guide both the pointer and the decoder during the generation. Experimental results show that historical headlines of the same user can improve the headline generation significantly, and both the contrastive learning module and the two style features fusion methods can further boost the performance.","No"

In contrast, humans often provide corrections to each other through natural language. Taking inspiration from this, we explore natural language patches -- declarative statements that allow developers to provide corrective feedback at the right level of abstraction, either overriding the model (``if a review gives 2 stars, the sentiment is negative'') or providing additional information the model may lack (``if something is described as the bomb, then it is good''). We model the task of determining if a patch applies separately from the task of integrating patch information, and show that with a small amount of synthetic data, we can teach models to effectively use real patches on real data -- 1 to 7 patches improve accuracy by ~1-4 accuracy points on different slices of a sentiment analysis dataset, and F1 by 7 points on a relation extraction dataset. Finally, we show that finetuning on as many as 100 labeled examples may be needed to match the performance of a small set of language patches.","No"

"Probing neural language models for understanding of words of estimative probability","Damien Sileo and Marie-Francine Moens",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03358","Words of estimative probability (WEP) are expressions of a statement's plausibility (probably, maybe, likely, doubt, likely, unlikely, impossible...). Multiple surveys demonstrate the agreement of human evaluators when assigning numerical probability levels to WEP. For example, highly likely corresponds to a median chance of 0.90+-0.08 in Fagen-Ulmschneider (2015)'s survey. In this work, we measure the ability of neural language processing models to capture the consensual probability level associated to each WEP. Firstly, we use the UNLI dataset (Chen et al., 2020) which associates premises and hypotheses with their perceived joint probability p, to construct prompts, e.g. '[PREMISE]. [WEP], [HYPOTHESIS].' and assess whether language models can predict whether the WEP consensual probability level is close to p. Secondly, we construct a dataset of WEP-based probabilistic reasoning, to test whether language models can reason with WEP compositions. When prompted '[EVENTA] is likely. [EVENTB] is impossible.', a causal language model should not express that [EVENTA&B] is likely. We show that both tasks are unsolved by off-the-shelf English language models, but that fine-tuning leads to transferable improvement.","No"

Smith and Roy Schwartz",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03495","The attention mechanism is considered the backbone of the widely-used Transformer architecture. It contextualizes the input by computing input-specific attention matrices. We find that this mechanism, while powerful and elegant, is not as important as typically thought for pretrained language models. We introduce PAPA, a new probing method that replaces the input-dependent attention matrices with constant ones -- the average attention weights over multiple inputs. We use PAPA to analyze several established pretrained Transformers on six downstream tasks. We find that without any input-dependent attention, all models achieve competitive performance -- an average relative drop of only 8% from the probing baseline. Further, little or no performance drop is observed when replacing half of the input-dependent attention matrices with constant (input-independent) ones. Interestingly, we show that better-performing models lose more from applying our method than weaker models, suggesting that the utilization of the input-dependent attention mechanism might be a factor in their success. Our results motivate research on simpler alternatives to input-dependent attention, as well as on methods for better utilization of this mechanism in the Transformer architecture.","No"

Social media platforms such as Twitter play an important role in raising public awareness and spreading knowledge about the dangers of the current climate crisis. With the increasing number of campaigns and communication about climate change through social media, the information could create more awareness and reach the general public and policy makers. However, these Twitter communications lead to polarization of beliefs, opinion-dominated ideologies, and often a split into two communities of climate change deniers and believers. In this paper, we propose a framework that helps identify denier statements on Twitter and thus classifies the stance of the tweet into one of the two attitudes towards climate change (denier/believer). The sentimental aspects of Twitter data on climate change are deeply rooted in general public attitudes toward climate change. Therefore, our work focuses on learning two closely related tasks: Stance Detection and Sentiment Analysis of climate change tweets. We propose a multi-task framework that performs stance detection (primary task) and sentiment analysis (auxiliary task) simultaneously. The proposed model incorporates the feature-specific and shared-specific attention frameworks to fuse multiple features and learn the generalized features for both tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed framework increases the performance of the primary task, i.e., stance detection by benefiting from the auxiliary task, i.e., sentiment analysis compared to its uni-modal and single-task variants.","No"

Recent work has relied on word embedding bias measures, such as WEAT. However, several representation issues of embeddings can harm the measures' accuracy, including low-resource settings and token frequency differences. In this work, we study what kind of embedding algorithm serves best to accurately measure types of social bias known to exist in US online news articles. To cover the whole spectrum of political bias in the US, we collect 500k articles and review psychology literature with respect to expected social bias. We then quantify social bias using WEAT along with embedding algorithms that account for the aforementioned issues.

Comparing ranked lists of multiple generated responses against the 'gold response' (from training data) reveals a wide diversity in response quality, with many good responses placed lower in the ranked list. The main challenge, addressed in this work, is then how to reach beyond greedily generated system responses, that is, how to obtain and select such high-quality responses from the list of overgenerated responses at inference without availability of the gold response. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method which aims to select high-quality items from the lists of responses initially overgenerated by the system. The idea is to use any sequence-level (similarity) scoring function to divide the semantic space of responses into high-scoring versus low-scoring partitions. At training, the high-scoring partition comprises all generated responses whose similarity to the gold response is higher than the similarity of the greedy response to the gold response. At inference, the aim is to estimate the probability that each overgenerated response belongs to the high-scoring partition, given only previous dialogue history. We validate the robustness and versatility of our proposed method on the standard MultiWOZ dataset: our methods improve a state-of-the-art E2E ToD system by 2.4 BLEU, 3.2 ROUGE, and 2.8 METEOR scores, achieving new peak results.

This so-called off-manifold conjecture has inspired a novel line of defenses against adversarial attacks on images. In this study, we find a similar phenomenon occurs in the contextualized embedding space induced by pretrained language models, in which adversarial texts tend to have their embeddings diverge from the manifold of natural ones. Based on this finding, we propose Textual Manifold-based Defense (TMD), a defense mechanism that projects text embeddings onto an approximated embedding manifold before classification. It reduces the complexity of potential adversarial examples, which ultimately enhances the robustness of the protected model.

"Semantic Metadata Extraction from Dense Video Captioning","Johannes Scherer and Ansgar Scherp and Deepayan Bhowmik",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02982","Annotation of multimedia data by humans is time-consuming and costly, while reliable automatic generation of semantic metadata is a major challenge. We propose a framework to extract semantic metadata from automatically generated video captions. As metadata, we consider entities, the entities' properties, relations between entities, and the video category. We employ two state-of-the-art dense video captioning models with masked transformer (MT) and parallel decoding (PVDC) to generate captions for videos of the ActivityNet Captions dataset. Our experiments show that it is possible to extract entities, their properties, relations between entities, and the video category from the generated captions. We observe that the quality of the extracted information is mainly influenced by the quality of the event localization in the video as well as the performance of the event caption generation.","No"

"CLOP: Video-and-Language Pre-Training with Knowledge Regularizations","Guohao Li, Hu Yang, Feng He, Zhifan Feng, Yajuan Lyu, Hua Wu, Haifeng Wang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03314","Video-and-language pre-training has shown promising results for learning generalizable representations. Most existing approaches usually model video and text in an implicit manner, without considering explicit structural representations of the multi-modal content. We denote such form of representations as structural knowledge, which express rich semantics of multiple granularities. There are related works that propose object-aware approaches to inject similar knowledge as inputs. However, the existing methods usually fail to effectively utilize such knowledge as regularizations to shape a superior cross-modal representation space. To this end, we propose a Cross-modaL knOwledge-enhanced Pre-training (CLOP) method with Knowledge Regularizations. There are two key designs of ours: 1) a simple yet effective Structural Knowledge Prediction (SKP) task to pull together the latent representations of similar videos; and 2) a novel Knowledge-guided sampling approach for Contrastive Learning (KCL) to push apart cross-modal hard negative samples. We evaluate our method on four text-video retrieval tasks and one multi-choice QA task. The experiments show clear improvements, outperforming prior works by a substantial margin. Besides, we provide ablations and insights of how our methods affect the latent representation space, demonstrating the value of incorporating knowledge regularizations into video-and-language pre-training.","No"

In this paper, we provide a systematic review of existing KGE techniques based on representation spaces. Particularly, we build a fine-grained classification to categorise the models based on three mathematical perspectives of the representation spaces: (1) Algebraic perspective, (2) Geometric perspective, and (3) Analytical perspective. We introduce the rigorous definitions of fundamental mathematical spaces before diving into KGE models and their mathematical properties. We further discuss different KGE methods over the three categories, as well as summarise how spatial advantages work over different embedding needs. By collating the experimental results from downstream tasks, we also explore the advantages of mathematical space in different scenarios and the reasons behind them. We further state some promising research directions from a representation space perspective, with which we hope to inspire researchers to design their KGE models as well as their related applications with more consideration of their mathematical space properties.","No"

We first present an experimental design centered on choosing tasks for which human specialists succeed but unaided humans and current general AI systems fail. We then present a proof-of-concept experiment following meant to demonstrate a key feature of this experimental design and show its viability with two question-answering tasks: MMLU and time-limited QuALITY.

Instead, potential noise sources are visible on screen with the camera emulating the off-screen speaker's view of the outside world. This setting is different from prior work in audio-visual speech enhancement that relies on lip and facial visuals. In this paper, we first demonstrate that egocentric visual information is helpful for noise suppression. We compare object recognition and action classification based visual feature extractors, and investigate methods to align audio and visual representations. Then, we examine different fusion strategies for the aligned features, and locations within the noise suppression model to incorporate visual information. Experiments demonstrate that visual features are most helpful when used to generate additive correction masks. Finally, in order to ensure that the visual features are discriminative with respect to different noise types, we introduce a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes audio-visual noise suppression and video based acoustic event detection. This proposed multi-task framework outperforms the audio only baseline on all metrics, including a 0.16 PESQ improvement. Extensive ablations reveal the improved performance of the proposed model with multiple active distractors, over all noise types and across different SNRs.","No"

Objects also have physical properties such as mass, which the imaging pipeline is unable to directly capture. However, these properties can be estimated by utilizing cues from relative object motion and the dynamics introduced by collisions. In this paper, we introduce CRIPP-VQA, a new video question answering dataset for reasoning about the implicit physical properties of objects in a scene. CRIPP-VQA contains videos of objects in motion, annotated with questions that involve counterfactual reasoning about the effect of actions, questions about planning in order to reach a goal, and descriptive questions about visible properties of objects. The CRIPP-VQA test set enables evaluation under several out-of-distribution settings -- videos with objects with masses, coefficients of friction, and initial velocities that are not observed in the training distribution. Our experiments reveal a surprising and significant performance gap in terms of answering questions about implicit properties (the focus of this paper) and explicit properties of objects (the focus of prior work).","No"
"Where did you tweet from? Inferring the origin locations of tweets based on contextual information","Rabindra Lamsal, Aaron Harwood, Maria Rodriguez Read",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16506","Public conversations on Twitter comprise many pertinent topics including disasters, protests, politics, propaganda, sports, climate change, epidemics/pandemic outbreaks, etc., that can have both regional and global aspects. Spatial discourse analysis rely on geographical data. However, today less than 1% of tweets are geotagged; in both cases--point location or bounding place information. A major issue with tweets is that Twitter users can be at location A and exchange conversations specific to location B, which we call the Location A/B problem. The problem is considered solved if location entities can be classified as either origin locations (Location As) or non-origin locations (Location Bs). In this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework--the True Origin Model--to address the problem that uses machine-level natural language understanding to identify tweets that conceivably contain their origin location information. The model achieves promising accuracy at country (80%), state (67%), city (58%), county (56%) and district (64%) levels with support from a Location Extraction Model as basic as the CoNLL-2003-based RoBERTa. We employ a tweet contexualizer (locBERT) which is one of the core components of the proposed model, to investigate multiple tweets' distributions for understanding Twitter users' tweeting behavior in terms of mentioning origin and non-origin locations.

However, the traditional adaptation by further training on in-domain data rapidly weakens the model's ability to generalize to other domains, making the open-ended deployments of the adapted models prone to errors. This work introduces novel training objectives built upon a semantic similarity of the predicted tokens to the reference. Our results show that (1) avoiding the common assumption of a single correct prediction by constructing the training target from tokens' semantic similarity can mitigate catastrophic forgetting during domain adaptation, while (2) preserving the quality of the adaptation, (3) with negligible additions to compute costs. In the broader perspective, the objectives grounded in a soft token alignment pioneer the exploration of the middle ground between the efficient but naive exact-match token-level objectives and expressive but computationally- and resource-intensive sequential objectives.","No"

Since a different copy of the model is required for each task, this paradigm is infeasible for storage-constrained edge devices like mobile phones. In this paper, we propose SPARTAN, a parameter efficient (PE) and computationally fast architecture for edge devices that adds hierarchically organized sparse memory after each Transformer layer. SPARTAN freezes the PLM parameters and fine-tunes only its memory, thus significantly reducing storage costs by re-using the PLM backbone for different tasks. SPARTAN contains two levels of memory, with only a sparse subset of parents being chosen in the first level for each input, and children cells corresponding to those parents being used to compute an output representation. This sparsity combined with other architecture optimizations improves SPARTAN's throughput by over 90% during inference on a Raspberry Pi 4 when compared to PE baselines (adapters) while also outperforming the latter by 0.1 points on the GLUE benchmark. Further, it can be trained 34% faster in a few-shot setting, while performing within 0.9 points of adapters. Qualitative analysis shows that different parent cells in SPARTAN specialize in different topics, thus dividing responsibility efficiently.","No"

In this work, we show that a simple initialization regimen can overcome much of the effect of domain mismatch in cross-lingual transfer. We pre-train word and contextual embeddings on the concatenated domain-mismatched corpora, and use these as initializations for three tasks: MUSE UBLI, UN Parallel UNMT, and the SemEval 2017 cross-lingual word similarity task. In all cases, our results challenge the conclusions of prior work by showing that proper initialization can recover a large portion of the losses incurred by domain mismatch.","No"

"Explicit Knowledge Transfer for Weakly-Supervised Code Generation","Zhangir Azerbayev, Ansong Ni, Hailey Schoelkopf, Dragomir Radev",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16740","Large language models (LLMs) can acquire strong code-generation capabilities through few-shot learning. In contrast, supervised fine-tuning is still needed for smaller models to achieve good performance. Such fine-tuning demands a large number of task-specific NL-code pairs, which are expensive to obtain. In this paper, we attempt to transfer the code generation ability of an LLM to a smaller model with the aid of weakly-supervised data. More specifically, we propose explicit knowledge transfer (EKT), which uses the few-shot capabilities of a teacher LLM to create NL-code pairs that we then filter for correctness and fine-tune the student on. We evaluate EKT on the task of generating code solutions to math word problems from the GSM8k dataset. We find that EKT not only yields better performance than training with expert iteration, but also outperforms knowledge distillation, another form of knowledge transfer. A GPT-Neo 1.3B model trained using EKT with a GPT-J teacher achieves a 12.4% pass@100 on GSM8k, while the same student and teacher trained with knowledge distillation yield only a 3.7% pass@100.

"A Probabilistic-Logic based Commonsense Representation Framework for Modelling Inferences with Multiple Antecedents and Varying Likelihoods","Shantanu Jaiswal, Liu Yan, Dongkyu Choi, Kenneth Kwok",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16822","Commonsense knowledge-graphs (CKGs) are important resources towards building machines that can 'reason' on text or environmental inputs and make inferences beyond perception. While current CKGs encode world knowledge for a large number of concepts and have been effectively utilized for incorporating commonsense in neural models, they primarily encode declarative or single-condition inferential knowledge and assume all conceptual beliefs to have the same likelihood. Further, these CKGs utilize a limited set of relations shared across concepts and lack a coherent knowledge organization structure resulting in redundancies as well as sparsity across the larger knowledge graph. Consequently, today's CKGs, while useful for a first level of reasoning, do not adequately capture deeper human-level commonsense inferences which can be more nuanced and influenced by multiple contextual or situational factors. Accordingly, in this work, we study how commonsense knowledge can be better represented by -- (i) utilizing a probabilistic logic representation scheme to model composite inferential knowledge and represent conceptual beliefs with varying likelihoods, and (ii) incorporating a hierarchical conceptual ontology to identify salient concept-relevant relations and organize beliefs at different conceptual levels. Our resulting knowledge representation framework can encode a wider variety of world knowledge and represent beliefs flexibly using grounded concepts as well as free-text phrases. As a result, the framework can be utilized as both a traditional free-text knowledge graph and a grounded logic-based inference system more suitable for neuro-symbolic applications. We describe how we extend the PrimeNet knowledge base with our framework through crowd-sourcing and expert-annotation, and demonstrate its application for more interpretable passage-based semantic parsing and question answering.","No"

But is fine-grained decomposition always a winning strategy? In this paper we systematically compare different granularities of decomposition -- from document to sub-sentence level, and we show that the answer is no. Our results show that incorporating additional context can yield improvement, but that this does not necessarily apply to all datasets. We also show that small changes to previously proposed entailment-based scoring methods can result in better performance, highlighting the need for caution in model and methodology selection for downstream tasks.","No"

In response to this problem, we introduce a rephraser to provide a better training target for NAT by rephrasing the reference sentence according to the NAT output. As we train NAT based on the rephraser output rather than the reference sentence, the rephraser output should fit well with the NAT output and not deviate too far from the reference, which can be quantified as reward functions and optimized by reinforcement learning.

To ensure the translated speech to be well aligned with the corresponding video, the length/duration of the translated speech should be as close as possible to that of the original speech, which requires strict length control. Previous works usually control the number of words or characters generated by the machine translation model to be similar to the source sentence, without considering the isochronicity of speech as the speech duration of words/characters in different languages varies. In this paper, we propose a machine translation system tailored for the task of video dubbing, which directly considers the speech duration of each token in translation, to match the length of source and target speech. Specifically, we control the speech length of generated sentence by guiding the prediction of each word with the duration information, including the speech duration of itself as well as how much duration is left for the remaining words. We design experiments on four language directions (German -> English, Spanish -> English, Chinese <-> English), and the results show that the proposed method achieves better length control ability on the generated speech than baseline methods.

The resulting data scarcity causes current BioNER approaches to be prone to overfitting, to suffer from limited generalizability, and to address a single entity type at a time (e.g., gene or disease). We therefore propose a novel all-in-one (AIO) scheme that uses external data from existing annotated resources to improve generalization.

Past research on detecting abusive language covers different platforms, languages, demographies, etc. However, models trained using these datasets do not perform well in cross-domain evaluation settings. To overcome this, a common strategy is to use a few samples from the target domain to train models to get better performance in that domain (cross-domain few-shot training). However, this might cause the models to overfit the artefacts of those samples. A compelling solution could be to guide the models toward rationales, i.e., spans of text that justify the text's label. This method has been found to improve model performance in the in-domain setting across various NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose RAFT (Rationale Adaptor for Few-shoT classification) for abusive language detection. We first build a multitask learning setup to jointly learn rationales, targets, and labels, and find a significant improvement of 6% macro F1 on the rationale detection task over training solely rationale classifiers. We introduce two rationale-integrated BERT-based architectures (the RAFT models) and evaluate our systems over five different abusive language datasets, finding that in the few-shot classification setting, RAFT-based models outperform baseline models by about 7% in macro F1 scores and perform competitively to models finetuned on other source domains. Furthermore, RAFT-based models outperform LIME/SHAP-based approaches in terms of plausibility and are close in performance in terms of faithfulness.","No"
"Handling and extracting key entities from customer conversations using Speech recognition and Named Entity recognition","Sharvi Endait, Ruturaj Ghatage, Prof. DD Kadam",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17107","In this modern era of technology with e-commerce developing at a rapid pace, it is very important to understand customer requirements and details from a business conversation. It is very crucial for customer retention and satisfaction. Extracting key insights from these conversations is very important when it comes to developing their product or solving their issue. Understanding customer feedback, responses, and important details of the product are essential and it would be done using Named entity recognition (NER). For extracting the entities we would be converting the conversations to text using the optimal speech-to-text model. The model would be a two-stage network in which the conversation is converted to text. Then, suitable entities are extracted using robust techniques using a NER BERT transformer model. This will aid in the enrichment of customer experience when there is an issue which is faced by them. If a customer faces a problem he will call and register his complaint. The model will then extract the key features from this conversation which will be necessary to look into the problem. These features would include details like the order number, and the exact problem. All these would be extracted directly from the conversation and this would reduce the effort of going through the conversation again.","No"

Combining multiple data sources is crucial to generate a complete picture of disease prevalence, incidence and trajectories. The standard approach to combining clinical data involves collating clinical terms across different terminology systems using curated maps, which are often inaccurate and/or incomplete. Here, we propose sEHR-CE, a novel framework based on transformers to enable integrated phenotyping and analyses of heterogeneous clinical datasets without relying on these mappings. We unify clinical terminologies using textual descriptors of concepts, and represent individuals' EHR as sections of text. We then fine-tune pre-trained language models to predict disease phenotypes more accurately than non-text and single terminology approaches. We validate our approach using primary and secondary care data from the UK Biobank, a large-scale research study. Finally, we illustrate in a type 2 diabetes use case how sEHR-CE identifies individuals without diagnosis that share clinical characteristics with patients.","No"
"BudgetLongformer: Can we Cheaply Pretrain a SotA Legal Language Model From Scratch?","Joel Niklaus, Daniele Giofr\'e",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17135","Pretrained transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art results in many tasks and benchmarks recently. Many state-of-the-art Language Models (LMs), however, do not scale well above the threshold of 512 input tokens. In specialized domains though (such as legal, scientific or biomedical), models often need to process very long text (sometimes well above 10000 tokens). Even though many efficient transformers have been proposed (such as Longformer, BigBird or FNet), so far, only very few such efficient models are available for specialized domains. Additionally, since the pretraining process is extremely costly in general - but even more so as the sequence length increases - it is often only in reach of large research labs. One way of making pretraining cheaper is the Replaced Token Detection (RTD) task, by providing more signal during training, since the loss can be computed over all tokens. In this work, we train Longformer models with the efficient RTD task on legal data to showcase that pretraining efficient LMs is possible using much less compute. We evaluate the trained models on challenging summarization tasks requiring the model to summarize long texts to show to what extent the models can achieve good performance on downstream tasks. We find that both the small and base models outperform their baselines on the in-domain BillSum and out-of-domain PubMed tasks in their respective parameter range.

We find that 25% of questions contain false presuppositions, and provide annotations for these presuppositions and their corrections. Through extensive baseline experiments, we show that adaptations of existing open-domain QA models can find presuppositions moderately well, but struggle when predicting whether a presupposition is factually correct. This is in large part due to difficulty in retrieving relevant evidence passages from a large text corpus. CREPE provides a benchmark to study question answering in the wild, and our analyses provide avenues for future work in better modeling and further studying the task.","No"
"Proactive Moderation of Online Discussions: Existing Practices and the Potential for Algorithmic Support","Charlotte Schluger, Jonathan P. Chang, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, Karen Levy",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16525","To address the widespread problem of uncivil behavior, many online discussion platforms employ human moderators to take action against objectionable content, such as removing it or placing sanctions on its authors. This reactive paradigm of taking action against already-posted antisocial content is currently the most common form of moderation, and has accordingly underpinned many recent efforts at introducing automation into the moderation process. Comparatively less work has been done to understand other moderation paradigms -- such as proactively discouraging the emergence of antisocial behavior rather than reacting to it -- and the role algorithmic support can play in these paradigms. In this work, we investigate such a proactive framework for moderation in a case study of a collaborative setting: Wikipedia Talk Pages. We employ a mixed methods approach, combining qualitative and design components for a holistic analysis. Through interviews with moderators, we find that despite a lack of technical and social support, moderators already engage in a number of proactive moderation behaviors, such as preemptively intervening in conversations to keep them on track. Further, we explore how automation could assist with this existing proactive moderation workflow by building a prototype tool, presenting it to moderators, and examining how the assistance it provides might fit into their workflow. The resulting feedback uncovers both strengths and drawbacks of the prototype tool and suggests concrete steps towards further developing such assisting technology so it can most effectively support moderators in their existing proactive moderation workflow.","No"

Embodied agents performing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in the wild must be able to handle this diversity, while also following arbitrary language instructions. Recently, Vision-Language models like CLIP have shown great performance on the task of zero-shot object recognition. In this work, we ask if these models are also capable of zero-shot language grounding. In particular, we utilize CLIP to tackle the novel problem of zero-shot VLN using natural language referring expressions that describe target objects, in contrast to past work that used simple language templates describing object classes. We examine CLIP's capability in making sequential navigational decisions without any dataset-specific finetuning, and study how it influences the path that an agent takes. Our results on the coarse-grained instruction following task of REVERIE demonstrate the navigational capability of CLIP, surpassing the supervised baseline in terms of both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL). More importantly, we quantitatively show that our CLIP-based zero-shot approach generalizes better to show consistent performance across environments when compared to SOTA, fully supervised learning approaches when evaluated via Relative Change in Success (RCS).","No"

Second, by analyzing the model parameters, we found that the typical growth pattern is not only a logistic function, which often appears in various complex systems, but also a nontrivial growth curve that starts with an exponential function and asymptotically approaches a power function without a steady state. Furthermore, we observed a connection between the functional form of growth and the peak-out. Finally, we showed that the proposed model and statistical properties are also valid for Google Trends data (English, French, Spanish, and Japanese), which is a time series of the nationwide popularity of search queries.","No"
"Logic and Commonsense-Guided Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion","Guanglin Niu, Bo Li",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16865","A temporal knowledge graph (TKG) stores the events derived from the data involving time. Predicting events is extremely challenging due to the time-sensitive property of events. Besides, the previous TKG completion (TKGC) approaches cannot represent both the timeliness and the causality properties of events, simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose a Logic and Commonsense-Guided Embedding model (LCGE) to jointly learn the time-sensitive representation involving timeliness and causality of events, together with the time-independent representation of events from the perspective of commonsense. Specifically, we design a temporal rule learning algorithm to construct a rule-guided predicate embedding regularization strategy for learning the causality among events. Furthermore, we could accurately evaluate the plausibility of events via auxiliary commonsense knowledge. The experimental results of TKGC task illustrate the significant performance improvements of our model compared with the existing approaches. More interestingly, our model is able to provide the explainability of the predicted results in the view of causal inference.

In this paper, we focus on an overlooked aspect of the overlap bias in NLI models: the reverse word-overlap bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that current NLI models are highly biased towards the non-entailment label on instances with low overlap, and the existing debiasing methods, which are reportedly successful on existing challenge datasets, are generally ineffective in addressing this category of bias. We investigate the reasons for the emergence of the overlap bias and the role of minority examples in its mitigation. For the former, we find that the word-overlap bias does not stem from pre-training, and for the latter, we observe that in contrast to the accepted assumption, eliminating minority examples does not affect the generalizability of debiasing methods with respect to the overlap bias.","No"

Specifically, we measure acoustic, phonetic, and word-level properties encoded in individual layers, using a lightweight analysis tool based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We find that these properties evolve across layers differently depending on the model, and the variations relate to the choice of pre-training objective. We further investigate the utility of our analyses for downstream tasks by comparing the property trends with performance on speech recognition and spoken language understanding tasks. We discover that CCA trends provide reliable guidance to choose layers of interest for downstream tasks and that single-layer performance often matches or improves upon using all layers, suggesting implications for more efficient use of pre-trained models.","No"

Because supervision data are scarce in the target domain, addressing the domain shifts without supervision data is necessary. This paper proposes an unsupervised domain adaptation method by filling vocabulary and word-frequency gaps. First, we expand a vocabulary and execute continual pretraining with a masked language model on a corpus of the target domain. Then, we multiply SPLADE-encoded sparse vectors by inverse document frequency weights to consider the importance of documents with lowfrequency words.

Empirical study shows that our investigation successfully finds the conditions where the NMT model could easily fail and need related knowledge. Experiments on six diverse target domains and two language-pairs show that pruning according to local correctness brings a light and more explainable memory for kNN-MT domain adaptation.","No"

A clear example is air traffic control (ATC) communications. ATC aims at guiding aircraft and controlling the airspace in a safe and optimal manner. These voice-based dialogues are carried between an air traffic controller (ATCO) and pilots via very-high frequency radio channels. In order to incorporate these novel technologies into ATC (low-resource domain), large-scale annotated datasets are required to develop the data-driven AI systems. Two examples are automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU). In this paper, we introduce the ATCO2 corpus, a dataset that aims at fostering research on the challenging ATC field, which has lagged behind due to lack of annotated data. The ATCO2 corpus covers 1) data collection and pre-processing, 2) pseudo-annotations of speech data, and 3) extraction of ATC-related named entities. The ATCO2 corpus is split into three subsets. 1) ATCO2-test-set corpus contains 4 hours of ATC speech with manual transcripts and a subset with gold annotations for named-entity recognition (callsign, command, value). 2) The ATCO2-PL-set corpus consists of 5281 hours of unlabeled ATC data enriched with automatic transcripts from an in-domain speech recognizer, contextual information, speaker turn information, signal-to-noise ratio estimate and English language detection score per sample. Both available for purchase through ELDA at http://catalog.elra.info/en-us/repository/browse/ELRA-S0484. 3) The ATCO2-test-set-1h corpus is a one-hour subset from the original test set corpus, that we are offering for free at https://www.atco2.org/data. We expect the ATCO2 corpus will foster research on robust ASR and NLU not only in the field of ATC communications but also in the general research community.","No"

However, existing knowledge probing works only focus on evaluating factual knowledge of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and ignore conceptual knowledge. Since conceptual knowledge often appears as implicit commonsense behind texts, designing probes for conceptual knowledge is hard. Inspired by knowledge representation schemata, we comprehensively evaluate conceptual knowledge of PLMs by designing three tasks to probe whether PLMs organize entities by conceptual similarities, learn conceptual properties, and conceptualize entities in contexts, respectively. For the tasks, we collect and annotate 24k data instances covering 393 concepts, which is COPEN, a COnceptual knowledge Probing bENchmark. Extensive experiments on different sizes and types of PLMs show that existing PLMs systematically lack conceptual knowledge and suffer from various spurious correlations.

However, studies have shown the lack of robustness still exists in prompt learning, since suitable initialization of continuous prompt and expert-first manual prompt are essential in fine-tuning process. What is more, human also utilize their comparative ability to motivate their existing knowledge for distinguishing different examples. Motivated by this, we explore how to use contrastive samples to strengthen prompt learning. In detail, we first propose our model ConsPrompt combining with prompt encoding network, contrastive sampling module, and contrastive scoring module. Subsequently, two sampling strategies, similarity-based and label-based strategies, are introduced to realize differential contrastive learning. The effectiveness of proposed ConsPrompt is demonstrated in five different few-shot learning tasks and shown the similarity-based sampling strategy is more effective than label-based in combining contrastive learning. Our results also exhibits the state-of-the-art performance and robustness in different few-shot settings, which proves that the ConsPrompt could be assumed as a better knowledge probe to motivate PLMs.","No"

We demonstrate that conciseness is a difficult task for which zero-shot setups with large neural language models often do not perform well. Given the limitations of these approaches, we propose a synthetic data generation method based on round-trip translations. Using this data to either train Transformers from scratch or fine-tune T5 models yields our strongest baselines that can be further improved by fine-tuning on an artificial conciseness dataset that we derived from multi-annotator machine translation test sets.","No"
"Active Learning with Tabular Language Models","Martin Ringsquandl, Aneta Koleva",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04128","Despite recent advancements in tabular language model research, real-world applications are still challenging. In industry, there is an abundance of tables found in spreadsheets, but acquisition of substantial amounts of labels is expensive, since only experts can annotate the often highly technical and domain-specific tables.

In this paper we investigate different acquisition functions in a real-world industrial tabular language model use case for sub-cell named entity recognition. Our results show that cell-level acquisition functions with built-in diversity can significantly reduce the labeling effort, while enforced table diversity is detrimental. We further see open fundamental questions concerning computational efficiency and the perspective of human annotators.","No"

Previous work has demonstrated that self-training can achieve competitive word alignment results. In this paper, we propose to use word alignments generated by a third-party word aligner to supervise the neural word alignment training. Specifically, source word and target word of each word pair aligned by the third-party aligner are trained to be close neighbors to each other in the contextualized embedding space when fine-tuning a pre-trained cross-lingual language model. Experiments on the benchmarks of various language pairs show that our approach can surprisingly do self-correction over the third-party supervision by finding more accurate word alignments and deleting wrong word alignments, leading to better performance than various third-party word aligners, including the currently best one. When we integrate all supervisions from various third-party aligners, we achieve state-of-the-art word alignment performances, with averagely more than two points lower alignment error rates than the best third-party aligner.

"Preserving Semantics in Textual Adversarial Attacks","David Herel and Hugo Cisneros and Tomas Mikolov",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04205","Adversarial attacks in NLP challenge the way we look at language models. The goal of this kind of adversarial attack is to modify the input text to fool a classifier while maintaining the original meaning of the text. Although most existing adversarial attacks claim to fulfill the constraint of semantics preservation, careful scrutiny shows otherwise. We show that the problem lies in the text encoders used to determine the similarity of adversarial examples, specifically in the way they are trained. Unsupervised training methods make these encoders more susceptible to problems with antonym recognition. To overcome this, we introduce a simple, fully supervised sentence embedding technique called Semantics-Preserving-Encoder (SPE). The results show that our solution minimizes the variation in the meaning of the adversarial examples generated. It also significantly improves the overall quality of adversarial examples, as confirmed by human evaluators. Furthermore, it can be used as a component in any existing attack to speed up its execution while maintaining similar attack success.","No"
"Active Relation Discovery: Towards General and Label-aware Open Relation Extraction","Yangning Li, Yinghui Li, Xi Chen, Hai-Tao Zheng, Ying Shen, Hong-Gee Kim",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04215","Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) aims to discover novel relations from open domains. Previous OpenRE methods mainly suffer from two problems: (1) Insufficient capacity to discriminate between known and novel relations. When extending conventional test settings to a more general setting where test data might also come from seen classes, existing approaches have a significant performance decline. (2) Secondary labeling must be performed before practical application. Existing methods cannot label human-readable and meaningful types for novel relations, which is urgently required by the downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose the Active Relation Discovery (ARD) framework, which utilizes relational outlier detection for discriminating known and novel relations and involves active learning for labeling novel relations.

Through qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that our text diffusion models generate samples comparable with those produced by standard autoregressive language models - while being in theory more efficient on accelerator hardware at inference time.

"Bridging Fairness and Environmental Sustainability in Natural Language Processing","Marius Hessenthaler, Emma Strubell, Dirk Hovy, Anne Lauscher",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04256","Fairness and environmental impact are important research directions for the sustainable development of artificial intelligence. However, while each topic is an active research area in natural language processing (NLP), there is a surprising lack of research on the interplay between the two fields. This lacuna is highly problematic, since there is increasing evidence that an exclusive focus on fairness can actually hinder environmental sustainability, and vice versa. In this work, we shed light on this crucial intersection in NLP by (1) investigating the efficiency of current fairness approaches through surveying example methods for reducing unfair stereotypical bias from the literature, and (2) evaluating a common technique to reduce energy consumption (and thus environmental impact) of English NLP models, knowledge distillation (KD), for its impact on fairness. In this case study, we evaluate the effect of important KD factors, including layer and dimensionality reduction, with respect to: (a) performance on the distillation task (natural language inference and semantic similarity prediction), and (b) multiple measures and dimensions of stereotypical bias (e.g., gender bias measured via the Word Embedding Association Test). Our results lead us to clarify current assumptions regarding the effect of KD on unfair bias: contrary to other findings, we show that KD can actually decrease model fairness.","No"
"SocioProbe: What, When, and Where Language Models Learn about Sociodemographics","Anne Lauscher, Federico Bianchi, Samuel Bowman, and Dirk Hovy",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04281","Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have outperformed other NLP models on a wide range of tasks. Opting for a more thorough understanding of their capabilities and inner workings, researchers have established the extend to which they capture lower-level knowledge like grammaticality, and mid-level semantic knowledge like factual understanding. However, there is still little understanding of their knowledge of higher-level aspects of language. In particular, despite the importance of sociodemographic aspects in shaping our language, the questions of whether, where, and how PLMs encode these aspects, e.g., gender or age, is still unexplored. We address this research gap by probing the sociodemographic knowledge of different single-GPU PLMs on multiple English data sets via traditional classifier probing and information-theoretic minimum description length probing. Our results show that PLMs do encode these sociodemographics, and that this knowledge is sometimes spread across the layers of some of the tested PLMs. We further conduct a multilingual analysis and investigate the effect of supplementary training to further explore to what extent, where, and with what amount of pre-training data the knowledge is encoded. Our overall results indicate that sociodemographic knowledge is still a major challenge for NLP. PLMs require large amounts of pre-training data to acquire the knowledge and models that excel in general language understanding do not seem to own more knowledge about these aspects.","No"

In this work, we introduce a two-stage adversarial example generation framework (NaturalAdversaries), for designing adversaries that are effective at fooling a given classifier and demonstrate natural-looking failure cases that could plausibly occur during in-the-wild deployment of the models. At the first stage a token attribution method is used to summarize a given classifier's behaviour as a function of the key tokens in the input. In the second stage a generative model is conditioned on the key tokens from the first stage. NaturalAdversaries is adaptable to both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks based on the level of access to the model parameters.

"A Multimodal Approach for Dementia Detection from Spontaneous Speech with Tensor Fusion Layer","Loukas Ilias, Dimitris Askounis, John Psarras",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04368","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder, meaning that the symptoms develop gradually throughout the years. It is also the main cause of dementia, which affects memory, thinking skills, and mental abilities. Nowadays, researchers have moved their interest towards AD detection from spontaneous speech, since it constitutes a time-effective procedure. However, existing state-of-the-art works proposing multimodal approaches do not take into consideration the inter- and intra-modal interactions and propose early and late fusion approaches. To tackle these limitations, we propose deep neural networks, which can be trained in an end-to-end trainable way and capture the inter- and intra-modal interactions. Firstly, each audio file is converted to an image consisting of three channels, i.e., log-Mel spectrogram, delta, and delta-delta. Next, each transcript is passed through a BERT model followed by a gated self-attention layer. Similarly, each image is passed through a Swin Transformer followed by an independent gated self-attention layer. Acoustic features are extracted also from each audio file. Finally, the representation vectors from the different modalities are fed to a tensor fusion layer for capturing the inter-modal interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on the ADReSS Challenge dataset indicate that our introduced approaches obtain valuable advantages over existing research initiatives reaching Accuracy and F1-score up to 86.25% and 85.48% respectively.","No"

"Word Order Matters when you Increase Masking","Karim Lasri and Alessandro Lenci and Thierry Poibeau",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04427","Word order, an essential property of natural languages, is injected in Transformer-based neural language models using position encoding. However, recent experiments have shown that explicit position encoding is not always useful, since some models without such feature managed to achieve state-of-the art performance on some tasks. To understand better this phenomenon, we examine the effect of removing position encodings on the pre-training objective itself (i.e., masked language modelling), to test whether models can reconstruct position information from co-occurrences alone. We do so by controlling the amount of masked tokens in the input sentence, as a proxy to affect the importance of position information for the task. We find that the necessity of position information increases with the amount of masking, and that masked language models without position encodings are not able to reconstruct this information on the task. These findings point towards a direct relationship between the amount of masking and the ability of Transformers to capture order-sensitive aspects of language using position encoding.","No"

Conventionally, only one embedding is extracted from each speech segment. However, because of the sliding window approach, a segment easily includes two or more speakers owing to speaker change points. This study proposes a novel embedding extractor architecture, referred to as a high-resolution embedding extractor (HEE), which extracts multiple high-resolution embeddings from each speech segment. Hee consists of a feature-map extractor and an enhancer, where the enhancer with the self-attention mechanism is the key to success. The enhancer of HEE replaces the aggregation process; instead of a global pooling layer, the enhancer combines relative information to each frame via attention leveraging the global context. Extracted dense frame-level embeddings can each represent a speaker. Thus, multiple speakers can be represented by different frame-level features in each segment. We also propose an artificially generating mixture data training framework to train the proposed HEE. Through experiments on five evaluation sets, including four public datasets, the proposed HEE demonstrates at least 10% improvement on each evaluation set, except for one dataset, which we analyse that rapid speaker changes less exist.","No"

"BER: Balanced Error Rate For Speaker Diarization","Tao Liu and Kai Yu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04304","DER is the primary metric to evaluate diarization performance while facing a dilemma: the errors in short utterances or segments tend to be overwhelmed by longer ones.

Although JER balances speaker errors, it still suffers from the same dilemma. Considering all those aspects, duration error, segment error, and speaker-weighted error constituting a complete diarization evaluation, we propose a Balanced Error Rate (BER) to evaluate speaker diarization. First, we propose a segment-level error rate (SER) via connected sub-graphs and adaptive IoU threshold to get accurate segment matching. Second, to evaluate diarization in a unified way, we adopt a speaker-specific harmonic mean between duration and segment, followed by a speaker-weighted average.

Moreover, some powerful language models are of extreme scale or inaccessible, making it inefficient, if not infeasible, to update their parameters for task-specific adaptation. We present Self-Correction, an approach that decouples an imperfect base generator (an off-the-shelf language model or supervised sequence-to-sequence model) from a separate corrector that learns to iteratively correct imperfect generations. To train the corrector, we propose an online training procedure that can use either scalar or natural language feedback on intermediate imperfect generations.

"Textless Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation with Discrete Speech Representation","Xinjian Li, Ye Jia, Chung-Cheng Chiu",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00115","Research on speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has progressed rapidly in recent years. Many end-to-end systems have been proposed and show advantages over conventional cascade systems, which are often composed of recognition, translation and synthesis sub-systems. However, most of the end-to-end systems still rely on intermediate textual supervision during training, which makes it infeasible to work for languages without written forms. In this work, we propose a novel model, Textless Translatotron, which is based on Translatotron 2, for training an end-to-end direct S2ST model without any textual supervision. Instead of jointly training with an auxiliary task predicting target phonemes as in Translatotron 2, the proposed model uses an auxiliary task predicting discrete speech representations which are obtained from learned or random speech quantizers. When a speech encoder pre-trained with unsupervised speech data is used for both models, the proposed model obtains translation quality nearly on-par with Translatotron 2 on the multilingual CVSS-C corpus as well as the bilingual Fisher Spanish-English corpus. On the latter, it outperforms the prior state-of-the-art textless model by +18.5 BLEU.","No"

"A Close Look into the Calibration of Pre-trained Language Models","Yangyi Chen, Lifan Yuan, Ganqu Cui, Zhiyuan Liu, Heng Ji",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00151","Pre-trained language models (PLMs) achieve remarkable performance on many downstream tasks, but may fail in giving reliable estimates of their predictive uncertainty. Given the lack of a comprehensive understanding of PLMs calibration, we take a close look into this new research problem, aiming to answer two questions: (1) Do PLMs learn to become calibrated in the training process? (2) How effective are existing calibration methods? For the first question, we conduct fine-grained control experiments to study the dynamic change in PLMs' calibration performance in training. We consider six factors as control variables, including dataset difficulty, available training samples, training steps, the number of tunable parameters, model scale, and pretraining. In experiments, we observe a consistent change in calibration performance across six factors. We find that PLMs don't learn to become calibrated in training, evidenced by the continual increase in confidence, no matter the predictions are correct or not. We highlight that our finding presents some contradiction with two established conclusions: (a) Larger PLMs are more calibrated; (b) Pretraining improves model calibration. Next, we study the effectiveness of existing calibration methods in mitigating the overconfidence issue, in both in-distribution and various out-of-distribution settings. Besides unlearnable calibration methods, we adapt two recently proposed learnable methods that directly collect data to train models to have reasonable confidence estimations. Also, we propose extended learnable methods based on existing ones to further improve or maintain PLMs calibration without sacrificing the original task performance. Experimental results show that learnable methods significantly reduce PLMs' confidence in wrong predictions, and our methods exhibit superior performance compared with previous methods.","No"
"Do LSTMs See Gender? Probing the Ability of LSTMs to Learn Abstract Syntactic Rules","Priyanka Sukumaran, Conor Houghton, Nina Kazanina",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00153","LSTMs trained on next-word prediction can accurately perform linguistic tasks that require tracking long-distance syntactic dependencies. Notably, model accuracy approaches human performance on number agreement tasks (Gulordava et al., 2018). However, we do not have a mechanistic understanding of how LSTMs perform such linguistic tasks. Do LSTMs learn abstract grammatical rules, or do they rely on simple heuristics? Here, we test gender agreement in French which requires tracking both hierarchical syntactic structures and the inherent gender of lexical units. Our model is able to reliably predict long-distance gender agreement in two subject-predicate contexts: noun-adjective and noun-passive-verb agreement. The model showed more inaccuracies on plural noun phrases with gender attractors compared to singular cases, suggesting a reliance on clues from gendered articles for agreement. Overall, our study highlights key ways in which LSTMs deviate from human behaviour and questions whether LSTMs genuinely learn abstract syntactic rules and categories. We propose using gender agreement as a useful probe to investigate the underlying mechanisms, internal representations, and linguistic capabilities of LSTM language models.","No"

In this work, we study how we can build a single model that can transition between these different configurations by leveraging multilingual models and Demux, a transformer-based model whose input includes the emotions of interest, enabling us to dynamically change the emotions predicted by the model. Demux also produces emotion embeddings, and performing operations on them allows us to transition to clusters of emotions by pooling the embeddings of each cluster.

One of the latest 2nd-pass rescoring model, Transformer Rescorer, takes the n-best initial outputs and audio embeddings from the 1st-pass model, and then choose the best output by re-scoring the n-best initial outputs. However, training this Transformer Rescorer requires expensive paired audio-text training data because the model uses audio embeddings as input. In this work, we present our Joint Audio/Text training method for Transformer Rescorer, to leverage unpaired text-only data which is relatively cheaper than paired audio-text data.

Ideally, a clinical expert will interpret these articles for exploratory analysis ranging from drug discovery for evaluating the efficacy of existing drugs in tackling emerging diseases to the first test of newly developed drugs. However, more than 100 CCS articles are published on PubMed every day. As a result, it can take days for a doctor to find articles and extract relevant information. Can we find a way to quickly sift through the long list of these articles faster and document the crucial takeaways from each of these articles? In this work, we propose CCS Explorer, an end-to-end system for relevance prediction of sentences, extractive summarization, and patient, outcome, and intervention entity detection from CCS. CCS Explorer is packaged in a web-based graphical user interface where the user can provide any disease name. CCS Explorer then extracts and aggregates all relevant information from articles on PubMed based on the results of an automatically generated query produced on the back-end. CCS Explorer fine-tunes pre-trained language models based on transformers with additional layers for each of these tasks. We evaluate the models using two publicly available datasets. CCS Explorer obtains a recall of 80.2%, AUC-ROC of 0.843, and an accuracy of 88.3% on sentence relevance prediction using BioBERT and achieves an average Micro F1-Score of 77.8% on Patient, Intervention, Outcome detection (PIO) using PubMedBERT.

"Why Is It Hate Speech? Masked Rationale Prediction for Explainable Hate Speech Detection","Jiyun Kim, Byounghan Lee, Kyung-Ah Sohn",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00243","In a hate speech detection model, we should consider two critical aspects in addition to detection performance-bias and explainability. Hate speech cannot be identified based solely on the presence of specific words: the model should be able to reason like humans and be explainable. To improve the performance concerning the two aspects, we propose Masked Rationale Prediction (MRP) as an intermediate task. MRP is a task to predict the masked human rationales-snippets of a sentence that are grounds for human judgment-by referring to surrounding tokens combined with their unmasked rationales. As the model learns its reasoning ability based on rationales by MRP, it performs hate speech detection robustly in terms of bias and explainability. The proposed method generally achieves state-of-the-art performance in various metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness for hate speech detection.","No"
"FADO: Feedback-Aware Double COntrolling Network for Emotional Support Conversation","Wei Peng, Ziyuan Qin, Yue Hu, Yuqiang Xie, Yunpeng Li",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00250","Emotional Support Conversation (ESConv) aims to reduce help-seekers'emotional distress with the supportive strategy and response. It is essential for the supporter to select an appropriate strategy with the feedback of the help-seeker (e.g., emotion change during dialog turns, etc) in ESConv. However, previous methods mainly focus on the dialog history to select the strategy and ignore the help-seeker's feedback, leading to the wrong and user-irrelevant strategy prediction. In addition, these approaches only model the context-to-strategy flow and pay less attention to the strategy-to-context flow that can focus on the strategy-related context for generating the strategy-constrain response. In this paper, we propose a Feedback-Aware Double COntrolling Network (FADO) to make a strategy schedule and generate the supportive response. The core module in FADO consists of a dual-level feedback strategy selector and a double control reader. Specifically, the dual-level feedback strategy selector leverages the turn-level and conversation-level feedback to encourage or penalize strategies. The double control reader constructs the novel strategy-to-context flow for generating the strategy-constrain response. Furthermore, a strategy dictionary is designed to enrich the semantic information of the strategy and improve the quality of strategy-constrain response. Experimental results on ESConv show that the proposed FADO has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in terms of both strategy selection and response generation.

"CARE: Causality Reasoning for Empathetic Responses by Conditional Graph Generation","Jiashuo Wang, Yi Cheng, Wenjie Li",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00255","Recent approaches to empathetic response generation incorporate emotion causalities to enhance comprehension of both the user's feelings and experiences. However, these approaches suffer from two critical issues. First, they only consider causalities between the user's emotion and the user's experiences, and ignore those between the user's experiences. Second, they neglect interdependence among causalities and reason them independently. To solve the above problems, we expect to reason all plausible causalities interdependently and simultaneously, given the user's emotion, dialogue history, and future dialogue content. Then, we infuse these causalities into response generation for empathetic responses. Specifically, we design a new model, i.e., the Conditional Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (CVGAE), for the causality reasoning, and adopt a multi-source attention mechanism in the decoder for the causality infusion. We name the whole framework as CARE, abbreviated for CAusality Reasoning for Empathetic conversation. Experimental results indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.","No"

However, such pairs can be difficult to obtain in low-resource settings and for some modality pairs (e.g., structured tables and images). In this work, we investigate the extent to which we can reduce the reliance on such parallel data, which we term \emph{bimodal supervision}, and use models that are pretrained on each modality independently. We experiment with a high-performing vision-language model, and analyze the effect of bimodal supervision on three vision-language tasks. We find that on simpler tasks, such as VQAv2 and GQA, one can eliminate bimodal supervision completely, suffering only a minor loss in performance. Conversely, for NLVR2, which requires more complex reasoning, training without bimodal supervision leads to random performance. Nevertheless, using only 5\% of the bimodal data (142K images along with their captions), or leveraging weak supervision in the form of a list of machine-generated labels for each image, leads to only a moderate degradation compared to using 3M image-text pairs: 74\%$\rightarrow$$\sim$70\%.

The factual robustness analysis on a wide range of current systems shows its good consistency with human judgments on faithfulness. Inspired by these findings, we propose to improve the faithfulness of a model by enhancing its factual robustness.

We collect paragraphs with diverse negation cues, then have crowdworkers ask questions about the implications of the negated statement in the passage. We also have workers make three kinds of edits to the passage -- paraphrasing the negated statement, changing the scope of the negation, and reversing the negation -- resulting in clusters of question-answer pairs that are difficult for models to answer with spurious shortcuts. CONDAQA features 14,182 question-answer pairs with over 200 unique negation cues and is challenging for current state-of-the-art models.

However, existing nested NER models heavily rely on training data annotated with nested entities, while labeling such data is costly. This study proposes a new subtask, nested-from-flat NER, which corresponds to a realistic application scenario: given data annotated with flat entities only, one may still desire the trained model capable of recognizing nested entities. To address this task, we train span-based models and deliberately ignore the spans nested inside labeled entities, since these spans are possibly unlabeled entities. With nested entities removed from the training data, our model achieves 54.8%, 54.2% and 41.1% F1 scores on the subset of spans within entities on ACE 2004, ACE 2005 and GENIA, respectively. This suggests the effectiveness of our approach and the feasibility of the task. In addition, the model's performance on flat entities is entirely unaffected. We further manually annotate the nested entities in the test set of CoNLL 2003, creating a nested-from-flat NER benchmark. Analysis results show that the main challenges stem from the data and annotation inconsistencies between the flat and nested entities.","No"

We discover an important cause of this loss, format specialization, where the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task and is unable to output anything beyond this format. We further show that format specialization happens at the beginning of fine-tuning. To solve this problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that preserves in-context abilities of the pretrained model. ProMoT first trains a soft prompt for the fine-tuning target task, and then fine-tunes the model itself with this soft prompt attached. ProMoT offloads task-specific formats into the soft prompt that can be removed when doing other in-context tasks. We fine-tune mT5 XXL with ProMoT on natural language inference (NLI) and English-French translation and evaluate the in-context abilities of the resulting models on 8 different NLP tasks. ProMoT achieves similar performance on the fine-tuned tasks compared with vanilla fine-tuning, but with much less reduction of in-context learning performances across the board. More importantly, ProMoT shows remarkable generalization ability on tasks that have different formats, e.g. fine-tuning on a NLI binary classification task improves the model's in-context ability to do summarization (+0.53 Rouge-2 score compared to the pretrained model), making ProMoT a promising method to build general purpose capabilities such as grounding and reasoning into LLMs with small but high quality datasets. When extended to sequential or multi-task training, ProMoT can achieve even better out-of-domain generalization performance.","No"

Prior conceptual graph construction approaches typically extract high-frequent, coarse-grained, and time-invariant concepts from formal texts. In real applications, however, it is necessary to extract less-frequent, fine-grained, and time-varying conceptual knowledge and build taxonomy in an evolving manner. In this paper, we introduce an approach to implementing and deploying the conceptual graph at Alibaba. Specifically, We propose a framework called AliCG which is capable of a) extracting fine-grained concepts by a novel bootstrapping with alignment consensus approach, b) mining long-tail concepts with a novel low-resource phrase mining approach, c) updating the graph dynamically via a concept distribution estimation method based on implicit and explicit user behaviors. We have deployed the framework at Alibaba UC Browser. Extensive offline evaluation as well as online A/B testing demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.","No"

Green",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00089","Although personalized automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have recently been designed to recognize even severely impaired speech, model performance may degrade over time for persons with degenerating speech. The aims of this study were to (1) analyze the change of performance of ASR over time in individuals with degrading speech, and (2) explore mitigation strategies to optimize recognition throughout disease progression. Speech was recorded by four individuals with degrading speech due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Word error rates (WER) across recording sessions were computed for three ASR models: Unadapted Speaker Independent (U-SI), Adapted Speaker Independent (A-SI), and Adapted Speaker Dependent (A-SD or personalized). The performance of all three models degraded significantly over time as speech became more impaired, but the performance of the A-SD model improved markedly when it was updated with recordings from the severe stages of speech progression. Recording additional utterances early in the disease before speech degraded significantly did not improve the performance of A-SD models. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of continuous recording (and model retraining) when providing personalized models for individuals with progressive speech impairments.","No"
"Speech-text based multi-modal training with bidirectional attention for improved speech recognition","Yuhang Yang, Haihua Xu, Hao Huang, Eng Siong Chng, Sheng Li",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00325","To let the state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR model enjoy data efficiency, as well as much more unpaired text data by multi-modal training, one needs to address two problems: 1) the synchronicity of feature sampling rates between speech and language (aka text data); 2) the homogeneity of the learned representations from two encoders. In this paper we propose to employ a novel bidirectional attention mechanism (BiAM) to jointly learn both ASR encoder (bottom layers) and text encoder with a multi-modal learning method. The BiAM is to facilitate feature sampling rate exchange, realizing the quality of the transformed features for the one kind to be measured in another space, with diversified objective functions. As a result, the speech representations are enriched with more linguistic information, while the representations generated by the text encoder are more similar to corresponding speech ones, and therefore the shared ASR models are more amenable for unpaired text data pretraining. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, we perform two categories of experiments with or without extra unpaired text data. Experimental results on Librispeech corpus show it can achieve up to 6.15% word error rate reduction (WERR) with only paired data learning, while 9.23% WERR when more unpaired text data is employed.","No"

Such MOS prediction models include MOSNet and LDNet that use spectral features as input, and SSL-MOS that relies on a pretrained self-supervised learning model that directly uses the speech signal as input. In modern high-quality neural TTS systems, prosodic appropriateness with regard to the spoken content is a decisive factor for speech naturalness. For this reason, we propose to include prosodic and linguistic features as additional inputs in MOS prediction systems, and evaluate their impact on the prediction outcome. We consider phoneme level F0 and duration features as prosodic inputs, as well as Tacotron encoder outputs, POS tags and BERT embeddings as higher-level linguistic inputs. All MOS prediction systems are trained on SOMOS, a neural TTS-only dataset with crowdsourced naturalness MOS evaluations. Results show that the proposed additional features are beneficial in the MOS prediction task, by improving the predicted MOS scores' correlation with the ground truths, both at utterance-level and system-level predictions.","No"

In this paper, we present a general framework for generating counterfactual explanations in the textual domain. Our framework is model-agnostic, representation-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and anytime. We model the task as a search problem in a space where the initial state is the classified text, and the goal state is a text in the complementary class. The operators transform a text by replacing parts of it. Our framework includes domain-independent operators, but can also exploit domain-specific knowledge through specialized operators.

This work addresses the task of generating gender-ambiguous text-to-speech (TTS) voices that do not correspond to any existing person. This is accomplished by sampling from a latent speaker embeddings' space that was formed while training a multilingual, multi-speaker TTS system on data from multiple male and female speakers. Various options are investigated regarding the sampling process. In our experiments, the effects of different sampling choices on the gender ambiguity and the naturalness of the resulting voices are evaluated. The proposed method is shown able to efficiently generate novel speakers that are superior to a baseline averaged speaker embedding. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic approach that can reliably generate a range of gender-ambiguous voices to meet diverse user requirements.","No"

One of the drawbacks of transducer is that it is difficult to decode in a fast and parallel way due to an unconstrained number of symbols that can be emitted per time step. In this work, we introduce a constrained version of transducer loss to learn strictly monotonic alignments between the sequences; we also improve the standard greedy search and beam search algorithms by limiting the number of symbols that can be emitted per time step in transducer decoding, making it more efficient to decode in parallel with batches. Furthermore, we propose an finite state automaton-based (FSA) parallel beam search algorithm that can run with graphs on GPU efficiently.

Although a few existing methods are able to achieve this goal, they are difficult to implement due to their dependency on external alignments. In this paper, we propose a simple way to penalize symbol delay in transducer model, so that we can balance the trade-off between symbol delay and accuracy for streaming models without external alignments. Specifically, our method adds a small constant times (T/2 - t), where T is the number of frames and t is the current frame, to all the non-blank log-probabilities (after normalization) that are fed into the two dimensional transducer recursion. For both streaming Conformer models and unidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) models, experimental results show that it can significantly reduce the symbol delay with an acceptable performance degradation. Our method achieves similar delay-accuracy trade-off to the previously published FastEmit, but we believe our method is preferable because it has a better justification: it is equivalent to penalizing the average symbol delay.

However, traditional KD methods suffer from teacher label storage issue, especially when the training corpora are large. Although on-the-fly teacher label generation tackles this issue, the training speed is significantly slower as the teacher model has to be evaluated every batch. In this paper, we reformulate the generation of teacher label as a codec problem. We propose a novel Multi-codebook Vector Quantization (MVQ) approach that compresses teacher embeddings to codebook indexes (CI). Based on this, a KD training framework (MVQ-KD) is proposed where a student model predicts the CI generated from the embeddings of a self-supervised pre-trained teacher model. Experiments on the LibriSpeech clean-100 hour show that MVQ-KD framework achieves comparable performance as traditional KD methods (l1, l2), while requiring 256 times less storage. When the full LibriSpeech dataset is used, MVQ-KD framework results in 13.8% and 8.2% relative word error rate reductions (WERRs) for non -streaming transducer on test-clean and test-other and 4.0% and 4.9% for streaming transducer.

We demonstrate that TrimTail is computationally cheap and can be applied online and optimized with any training loss or any model architecture on any dataset without any extra effort by applying it on various end-to-end streaming ASR networks either trained with CTC loss [1] or Transducer loss [2]. We achieve 100 $\sim$ 200ms latency reduction with equal or even better accuracy on both Aishell-1 and Librispeech.

Current works aim to explicitly factorize such fine-grained and utterance-level speech attributes into different representations extracted by modules that operate in the corresponding level. We show that the fine-grained latent space also captures coarse-grained information, which is more evident as the dimension of latent space increases in order to capture diverse prosodic representations. Therefore, a trade-off arises between the diversity of the token-level and utterance-level representations and their disentanglement. We alleviate this issue by first capturing rich speech attributes into a token-level latent space and then, separately train a prior network that given the input text, learns utterance-level representations in order to predict the phoneme-level, posterior latents extracted during the previous step. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Audio samples are available in our demo page.","No"

Wallace, Ani Nenkova",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08145","We provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of self-repetition in the output of neural summarizers. We measure self-repetition as the number of n-grams of length four or longer that appear in multiple outputs of the same system. We analyze the behavior of three popular architectures (BART, T5, and Pegasus), fine-tuned on five datasets. In a regression analysis, we find that the three architectures have different propensities for repeating content across output summaries for inputs, with BART being particularly prone to self-repetition. Fine-tuning on more abstractive data, and on data featuring formulaic language, is associated with a higher rate of self-repetition. In qualitative analysis we find systems produce artefacts such as ads and disclaimers unrelated to the content being summarized, as well as formulaic phrases common in the fine-tuning domain. Our approach to corpus-level analysis of self-repetition may help practitioners clean up training data for summarizers and ultimately support methods for minimizing the amount of self-repetition.","No"

Concretely, UniRPG consists of a neural programmer and a symbolic program executor, where a program is the composition of a set of pre-defined general atomic and higher-order operations and arguments extracted from table and text. First, the programmer parses a question into a program by generating operations and copying arguments, and then the executor derives answers from table and text based on the program.

Concretely, we propose a simple scheme to extract relevant contextual information into an approximate state hash as extra input for an RNN-based text agent. Such a lightweight plug-in achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art text agents using advanced NLU techniques such as knowledge graph and passage retrieval, suggesting non-NLU methods might suffice to tackle the challenge of partial observability. However, if we remove RNN encoders and use approximate or even ground-truth state hash alone, the model performs miserably, which confirms the importance of semantic function approximation to tackle the challenge of combinatorially large observation and action spaces.

A recent extension to the problem of multi-class classification of mental health issues is to identify the cause behind the user's intention. However, multi-class causal categorization for mental health issues on social media has a major challenge of wrong prediction due to the overlapping problem of causal explanations. There are two possible mitigation techniques to solve this problem: (i) Inconsistency among causal explanations/ inappropriate human-annotated inferences in the dataset, (ii) in-depth analysis of arguments and stances in self-reported text using discourse analysis. In this research work, we hypothesise that if there exists the inconsistency among F1 scores of different classes, there must be inconsistency among corresponding causal explanations as well.

Recent efforts on efficient attention improve scalability, but their effect on document translation remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of a recent linear attention model by Peng et al. (2021) on document translation and augment it with a sentential gate to promote a recency inductive bias.

"Model Criticism for Long-Form Text Generation","Yuntian Deng, Volodymyr Kuleshov, Alexander M. Rush",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08444","Language models have demonstrated the ability to generate highly fluent text; however, it remains unclear whether their output retains coherent high-level structure (e.g., story progression). Here, we propose to apply a statistical tool, model criticism in latent space, to evaluate the high-level structure of the generated text. Model criticism compares the distributions between real and generated data in a latent space obtained according to an assumptive generative process. Different generative processes identify specific failure modes of the underlying model. We perform experiments on three representative aspects of high-level discourse -- coherence, coreference, and topicality -- and find that transformer-based language models are able to capture topical structures but have a harder time maintaining structural coherence or modeling coreference.","No"
"StoryER: Automatic Story Evaluation via Ranking, Rating and Reasoning","Hong Chen, Duc Minh Vo, Hiroya Takamura, Yusuke Miyao, Hideki Nakayama",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08459","Existing automatic story evaluation methods place a premium on story lexical level coherence, deviating from human preference. We go beyond this limitation by considering a novel \textbf{Story} \textbf{E}valuation method that mimics human preference when judging a story, namely \textbf{StoryER}, which consists of three sub-tasks: \textbf{R}anking, \textbf{R}ating and \textbf{R}easoning. Given either a machine-generated or a human-written story, StoryER requires the machine to output 1) a preference score that corresponds to human preference, 2) specific ratings and their corresponding confidences and 3) comments for various aspects (e.g., opening, character-shaping). To support these tasks, we introduce a well-annotated dataset comprising (i) 100k ranked story pairs; and (ii) a set of 46k ratings and comments on various aspects of the story. We finetune Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED) on the collected dataset, with the encoder responsible for preference score and aspect prediction and the decoder for comment generation. Our comprehensive experiments result in a competitive benchmark for each task, showing the high correlation to human preference. In addition, we have witnessed the joint learning of the preference scores, the aspect ratings, and the comments brings gain in each single task.

We instead propose a novel generative self-supervised learning objective based on phrase reconstruction. To overcome the drawbacks of previous generative methods, we carefully model intra-sentence structure by breaking down one sentence into pieces of important phrases.

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the disparity that exists within the languages of the world. We show that simply categorising languages considering data availability may not be always correct. Using an existing language categorisation based on speaker population and vitality, we analyse the distribution of language data resources, amount of NLP/CL research, inclusion in multilingual web-based platforms and the inclusion in pre-trained multilingual models. We show that many languages do not get covered in these resources or platforms, and even within the languages belonging to the same language group, there is wide disparity. We analyse the impact of family, geographical location, GDP and the speaker population of languages and provide possible reasons for this disparity, along with some suggestions to overcome the same.","No"

This framework can be flexibly combined with existing mainstream PLMs. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge sub-graph from KBs for each context.

Many machine learning-based methods have been proposed for this task. However, to our best knowledge, existing methods all require manually crafted seed alignments, which are expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose the first fully automatic alignment method named TransAlign, which does not require any manually crafted seed alignments. Specifically, for predicate embeddings, TransAlign constructs a predicate-proximity-graph to automatically capture the similarity between predicates across two KGs by learning the attention of entity types. For entity embeddings, TransAlign first computes the entity embeddings of each KG independently using TransE, and then shifts the two KGs' entity embeddings into the same vector space by computing the similarity between entities based on their attributes. Thus, both predicate alignment and entity alignment can be done without manually crafted seed alignments. TransAlign is not only fully automatic, but also highly effective. Experiments using real-world KGs show that TransAlign improves the accuracy of entity alignment significantly compared to state-of-the-art methods.","No"

State-of-the-art methods based on pre-trained models have achieved remarkable performance on the standard test dataset. However, we question whether these methods really learn how to perform logical reasoning, rather than just relying on the spurious correlations between the headers of the tables and operators of the logical form. To verify this hypothesis, we manually construct a set of counterfactual samples, which modify the original logical forms to generate counterfactual logical forms with rarely co-occurred table headers and logical operators. SOTA methods give much worse results on these counterfactual samples compared with the results on the original test dataset, which verifies our hypothesis. To deal with this problem, we firstly analyze this bias from a causal perspective, based on which we propose two approaches to reduce the model's reliance on the shortcut. The first one incorporates the hierarchical structure of the logical forms into the model. The second one exploits automatically generated counterfactual data for training. Automatic and manual experimental results on the original test dataset and the counterfactual dataset show that our method is effective to alleviate the spurious correlation.

NormSAGE leverages the expressiveness and implicit knowledge of the pretrained GPT-3 language model backbone, to elicit knowledge about norms through directed questions representing the norm discovery task and conversation context. It further addresses the risk of language model hallucination with a self-verification mechanism ensuring that the norms discovered are correct and are substantially grounded to their source conversations. Evaluation results show that our approach discovers significantly more relevant and insightful norms for conversations on-the-fly compared to baselines (>10+% in Likert scale rating). The norms discovered from Chinese conversation are also comparable to the norms discovered from English conversation in terms of insightfulness and correctness (<3% difference). In addition, the culture-specific norms are promising quality, allowing for 80% accuracy in culture pair human identification. Finally, our grounding process in norm discovery self-verification can be extended for instantiating the adherence and violation of any norm for a given conversation on-the-fly, with explainability and transparency. NormSAGE achieves an AUC of 95.4% in grounding, with natural language explanation matching human-written quality.","No"

"Tracing Semantic Variation in Slang","Zhewei Sun and Yang Xu",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08635","The meaning of a slang term can vary in different communities. However, slang semantic variation is not well understood and under-explored in the natural language processing of slang. One existing view argues that slang semantic variation is driven by culture-dependent communicative needs. An alternative view focuses on slang's social functions suggesting that the desire to foster semantic distinction may have led to the historical emergence of community-specific slang senses. We explore these theories using computational models and test them against historical slang dictionary entries, with a focus on characterizing regularity in the geographical variation of slang usages attested in the US and the UK over the past two centuries. We show that our models are able to predict the regional identity of emerging slang word meanings from historical slang records. We offer empirical evidence that both communicative need and semantic distinction play a role in the variation of slang meaning yet their relative importance fluctuates over the course of history. Our work offers an opportunity for incorporating historical cultural elements into the natural language processing of slang.","No"

Event extraction therefore becomes a graph parsing problem, which provides the following advantages: 1) performing event detection and argument extraction jointly; 2) detecting and extracting multiple events from a piece of text; and 3) capturing the complicated interaction between event arguments and triggers. Experimental results on ACE2005 show that our model is competitive to state-of-the-art systems and has substantially improved the results on argument extraction.

To solve the common incomplete labeling problem, we propose a unified positive-unlabeled learning framework - shift and squared ranking loss positive-unlabeled (SSR-PU) learning. We use positive-unlabeled (PU) learning on document-level RE for the first time. Considering that labeled data of a dataset may lead to prior shift of unlabeled data, we introduce a PU learning under prior shift of training data. Also, using none-class score as an adaptive threshold, we propose squared ranking loss and prove its Bayesian consistency with multi-label ranking metrics.

Previous studies have explored generating implicit user profiles from the user's dialogue history for building personalized chatbots. However, these studies only use the response generation loss to train the entire model, thus it is prone to suffer from the problem of data sparsity. Besides, they overemphasize the final generated response's quality while ignoring the correlations and fusions between the user's dialogue history, leading to rough data representations and performance degradation. To tackle these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework MCP for capturing better representations from users' dialogue history for personalized chatbots. Specifically, we apply contrastive sampling methods to leverage the supervised signals hidden in user dialog history, and generate the pre-training samples for enhancing the model. We design three pre-training tasks based on three types of contrastive pairs from user dialogue history, namely response pairs, sequence augmentation pairs, and user pairs.

"Sequential Topic Selection Model with Latent Variable for Topic-Grounded Dialogue","Xiaofei Wen, Wei Wei and Xian-Ling Mao",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08801","Recently, topic-grounded dialogue system has attracted significant attention due to its effectiveness in predicting the next topic to yield better responses via the historical context and given topic sequence. However, almost all existing topic prediction solutions focus on only the current conversation and corresponding topic sequence to predict the next conversation topic, without exploiting other topic-guided conversations which may contain relevant topic-transitions to current conversation. To address the problem, in this paper we propose a novel approach, named Sequential Global Topic Attention (SGTA) to exploit topic transition over all conversations in a subtle way for better modeling post-to-response topic-transition and guiding the response generation to the current conversation. Specifically, we introduce a latent space modeled as a Multivariate Skew-Normal distribution with hybrid kernel functions to flexibly integrate the global-level information with sequence-level information, and predict the topic based on the distribution sampling results. We also leverage a topic-aware prior-posterior approach for secondary selection of predicted topics, which is utilized to optimize the response generation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms competitive baselines on prediction and generation tasks.","No"
"HCL-TAT: A Hybrid Contrastive Learning Method for Few-shot Event Detection with Task-Adaptive Threshold","Ruihan Zhang, Wei Wei, Xian-Ling Mao, Rui Fang, Dangyang Chen",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08806","Conventional event detection models under supervised learning settings suffer from the inability of transfer to newly-emerged event types owing to lack of sufficient annotations. A commonly-adapted solution is to follow a identify-then-classify manner, which first identifies the triggers and then converts the classification task via a few-shot learning paradigm. However, these methods still fall far short of expectations due to: (i) insufficient learning of discriminative representations in low-resource scenarios, and (ii) trigger misidentification caused by the overlap of the learned representations of triggers and non-triggers. To address the problems, in this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid Contrastive Learning method with a Task-Adaptive Threshold (abbreviated as HCLTAT), which enables discriminative representation learning with a two-view contrastive loss (support-support and prototype-query), and devises a easily-adapted threshold to alleviate misidentification of triggers. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset FewEvent demonstrate the superiority of our method to achieve better results compared to the state-of-the-arts.

However, the underlying retrieved noisy pairs will dramatically deteriorate the model performance. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary study and find that this problem results from not fully exploiting the prediction of the NMT model. To alleviate the impact of noise, we propose a confidence-enhanced kNN-MT model with robust training. Concretely, we introduce the NMT confidence to refine the modeling of two important components of kNN-MT: kNN distribution and the interpolation weight. Meanwhile we inject two types of perturbations into the retrieved pairs for robust training.

Previous works usually share relation representation across modalities. This results in mutual interference between modalities during training, since for a pair of entities, the relation from one modality probably contradicts that from another modality. Furthermore, making a unified prediction based on the shared relation representation treats the input in different modalities equally, while their importance to the MKGC task should be different. In this paper, we propose MoSE, a Modality Split representation learning and Ensemble inference framework for MKGC. Specifically, in the training phase, we learn modality-split relation embeddings for each modality instead of a single modality-shared one, which alleviates the modality interference. Based on these embeddings, in the inference phase, we first make modality-split predictions and then exploit various ensemble methods to combine the predictions with different weights, which models the modality importance dynamically.

Such explanations are emerging as an attractive option to provide actionable change to scenarios adversely impacted by classifiers' decisions. However, their extension to textual data is under-explored and there is little investigation on their vulnerabilities and limitations. This work motivates textual counterfactuals by laying the ground for a novel evaluation scheme inspired by the faithfulness of explanations. Accordingly, we extend the computation of three metrics, proximity,connectedness and stability, to textual data and we benchmark two successful contrastive methods, POLYJUICE and MiCE, on our suggested metrics. Experiments on sentiment analysis data show that the connectedness of counterfactuals to their original counterparts is not obvious in both models. More interestingly, the generated contrastive texts are more attainable with POLYJUICE which highlights the significance of latent representations in counterfactual search. Finally, we perform the first semantic adversarial attack on textual recourse methods. The results demonstrate the robustness of POLYJUICE and the role that latent input representations play in robustness and reliability.","No"

While recent work has leveraged entity and relation alignments from multiple KGs, such as alignments between multilingual KGs with common entities and relations, a deeper understanding of the ways in which multilingual KG completion (MKGC) can aid the creation of multilingual KG alignments (MKGA) is still limited. Motivated by the observation that structural inconsistencies -- the main challenge for MKGA models -- can be mitigated through KG completion methods, we propose a novel model for jointly completing and aligning knowledge graphs. The proposed model combines two components that jointly accomplish KG completion and alignment. These two components employ relation-aware graph neural networks that we propose to encode multi-hop neighborhood structures into entity and relation representations. Moreover, we also propose (i) a structural inconsistency reduction mechanism to incorporate information from the completion into the alignment component, and (ii) an alignment seed enlargement and triple transferring mechanism to enlarge alignment seeds and transfer triples during KGs alignment.

In the span extraction stage, we transform the sequential tags into a global boundary matrix, enabling the model to focus on the explicit boundary information. For mention classification, we leverage prototypical learning to capture the semantic representations for each labeled span and make the model better adapt to novel-class entities. To further improve the model performance, we split out the false positives generated by the span extractor but not labeled in the current episode set, and then present a margin-based loss to separate them from each prototype region.

Common approaches often assume access to additional OOD samples during the training stage, however, outlier distribution is often unknown in advance. Instead, we propose a post hoc framework called POORE - POsthoc pseudo-Ood REgularization, that generates pseudo-OOD samples using in-distribution (IND) data. The model is fine-tuned by introducing a new regularization loss that separates the embeddings of IND and OOD data, which leads to significant gains on the OOD prediction task during testing.

While reliability is a broad and vaguely defined term, this work decomposes reliability into four facets: generalizability, fairness, calibration, and factuality. We establish simple and effective prompts to demonstrate GPT-3's reliability in these four aspects: 1) generalize out-of-domain, 2) balance demographic distribution to reduce social biases, 3) calibrate language model probabilities, and 4) update the LLM's knowledge. We find that by employing appropriate prompts, GPT-3 outperforms smaller-scale supervised models by large margins on all these facets.

In a typical quasi-regularity task, English past tense inflections, the neural network model has long been criticized that it learns only to generalize the most frequent pattern, but not the regular pattern, thus can not learn the abstract categories of regular and irregular and is dissimilar to human performance. In this work, we train a set of transformer models with different settings to examine their behavior on this task. The models achieved high accuracy on unseen regular verbs and some accuracy on unseen irregular verbs. The models' performance on the regulars is heavily affected by type frequency and ratio but not token frequency and ratio, and vice versa for the irregulars. The different behaviors on the regulars and irregulars suggest that the models have some degree of symbolic learning on the regularity of the verbs. In addition, the models are weakly correlated with human behavior on nonce verbs. Although the transformer model exhibits some level of learning on the abstract category of verb regularity, its performance does not fit human data well, suggesting that it might not be a good cognitive model.","No"

Recently, instruction tuning (IT), which fine-tunes a pre-trained language model on a massive collection of tasks described via human-craft instructions, has been shown effective in instruction learning for unseen tasks. However, IT relies on a large amount of human-annotated samples, which restricts its generalization. Unlike labeled data, unlabeled data are often massive and cheap to obtain. In this work, we study how IT can be improved with unlabeled data. We first empirically explore the IT performance trends versus the number of labeled data, instructions, and training tasks. We find it critical to enlarge the number of training instructions, and the instructions can be underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. Then, we propose Unlabeled Data Augmented Instruction Tuning (UDIT) to take better advantage of the instructions during IT by constructing pseudo-labeled data from unlabeled plain texts.

For this purpose, we examine the impact of temporal variation on model explanations extracted by eight feature attribution methods and three select-then-predict models across six text classification tasks. Our experiments show that (i)faithfulness is not consistent under temporal variations across feature attribution methods (e.g. it decreases or increases depending on the method), with an attention-based method demonstrating the most robust faithfulness scores across datasets; and (ii) select-then-predict models are mostly robust in asynchronous settings with only small degradation in predictive performance. Finally, feature attribution methods show conflicting behavior when used in FRESH (i.e. a select-and-predict model) and for measuring sufficiency/comprehensiveness (i.e. as post-hoc methods), suggesting that we need more robust metrics to evaluate post-hoc explanation faithfulness.","No"

But on what tasks do language models fall short of average human-rater performance, and are those tasks actually unsolvable by current language models? In this work, we focus on a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench tasks which we call BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). These are the task for which prior language model evaluations did not outperform the average human-rater. We find that applying chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to BBH tasks enables PaLM to surpass the average human-rater performance on 10 of the 23 tasks, and Codex (code-davinci-002) to surpass the average human-rater performance on 17 of the 23 tasks. Since many tasks in BBH require multi-step reasoning, few-shot prompting without CoT, as done in the BIG-Bench evaluations (Srivastava et al., 2022), substantially underestimates the best performance and capabilities of language models, which is better captured via CoT prompting. As further analysis, we explore the interaction between CoT and model scale on BBH, finding that CoT enables emergent task performance on several BBH tasks with otherwise flat scaling curves.","No"

"Improving Radiology Summarization with Radiograph and Anatomy Prompts","Jinpeng Hu, Zhihong Chen, Yang Liu, Xiang Wan, Tsung-Hui Chang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08303","The impression is crucial for the referring physicians to grasp key information since it is concluded from the findings and reasoning of radiologists. To alleviate the workload of radiologists and reduce repetitive human labor in impression writing, many researchers have focused on automatic impression generation. However, recent works on this task mainly summarize the corresponding findings and pay less attention to the radiology images. In clinical, radiographs can provide more detailed valuable observations to enhance radiologists' impression writing, especially for complicated cases. Besides, each sentence in findings usually focuses on single anatomy, so they only need to be matched to corresponding anatomical regions instead of the whole image, which is beneficial for textual and visual features alignment. Therefore, we propose a novel anatomy-enhanced multimodal model to promote impression generation. In detail, we first construct a set of rules to extract anatomies and put these prompts into each sentence to highlight anatomy characteristics. Then, two separate encoders are applied to extract features from the radiograph and findings. Afterward, we utilize a contrastive learning module to align these two representations at the overall level and use a co-attention to fuse them at the sentence level with the help of anatomy-enhanced sentence representation. Finally, the decoder takes the fused information as the input to generate impressions. The experimental results on two benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art results.","No"
"Combination Of Convolution Neural Networks And Deep Neural Networks For Fake News Detection","Zainab A. Jawad, Ahmed J. Obaid",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08331","Nowadays, People prefer to follow the latest news on social media, as it is cheap, easily accessible, and quickly disseminated. However, it can spread fake or unreliable, low-quality news that intentionally contains false information. The spread of fake news can have a negative effect on people and society. Given the seriousness of such a problem, researchers did their best to identify patterns and characteristics that fake news may exhibit to design a system that can detect fake news before publishing. In this paper, we have described the Fake News Challenge stage #1 (FNC-1) dataset and given an overview of the competitive attempts to build a fake news detection system using the FNC-1 dataset. The proposed model was evaluated with the FNC-1 dataset. A competitive dataset is considered an open problem and a challenge worldwide. This system's procedure implies processing the text in the headline and body text columns with different natural language processing techniques. After that, the extracted features are reduced using the elbow truncated method, finding the similarity between each pair using the soft cosine similarity method. The new feature is entered into CNN and DNN deep learning approaches. The proposed system detects all the categories with high accuracy except the disagree category. As a result, the system achieves up to 84.6 % accuracy, classifying it as the second ranking based on other competitive studies regarding this dataset.","No"
"Character-Centric Story Visualization via Visual Planning and Token Alignment","Hong Chen, Rujun Han, Te-Lin Wu, Hideki Nakayama and Nanyun Peng",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08465","Story visualization advances the traditional text-to-image generation by enabling multiple image generation based on a complete story. This task requires machines to 1) understand long text inputs and 2) produce a globally consistent image sequence that illustrates the contents of the story. A key challenge of consistent story visualization is to preserve characters that are essential in stories. To tackle the challenge, we propose to adapt a recent work that augments Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) with a text-tovisual-token (transformer) architecture. Specifically, we modify the text-to-visual-token module with a two-stage framework: 1) character token planning model that predicts the visual tokens for characters only; 2) visual token completion model that generates the remaining visual token sequence, which is sent to VQ-VAE for finalizing image generations. To encourage characters to appear in the images, we further train the two-stage framework with a character-token alignment objective. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method excels at preserving characters and can produce higher quality image sequences compared with the strong baselines.

In detail, we decompose the informative visual signals into two parts: source-specific information and target-specific information. We use mutual information to quantify them and propose two methods for objective optimization to better leverage visual signals. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our approach can effectively enhance the visual awareness of MMT model and achieve superior results against strong baselines.","No"

To the end of extreme multimodal summarisation, we introduce a new task, eXtreme Multimodal Summarisation with Multimodal Output (XMSMO) for the scenario of TL;DW - Too Long; Didn't Watch, akin to TL;DR. XMSMO aims to summarise a video-document pair into a summary with an extremely short length, which consists of one cover frame as the visual summary and one sentence as the textual summary.

Consider the following two natural language search queries - (i) 'a queue of customers patiently waiting to buy ice cream' and (ii) 'a queue of tourists going to see a famous Mughal architecture in India.' Interpreting these queries requires one to reason with (i) Commonsense such as interpreting people as customers or tourists, actions as waiting to buy or going to see; and (ii) Fact or world knowledge associated with named visual entities, for example, whether the store in the image sells ice cream or whether the landmark in the image is a Mughal architecture located in India. Such reasoning goes beyond just visual recognition. To enable both commonsense and factual reasoning in the image search, we present a unified framework, namely Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Transformer (KRAMT), that treats the named visual entities in an image as a gateway to encyclopedic knowledge and leverages them along with natural language query to ground relevant knowledge. Further, KRAMT seamlessly integrates visual content and grounded knowledge to learn alignment between images and search queries. This unified framework is then used to perform image search requiring commonsense and factual reasoning. The retrieval performance of KRAMT is evaluated and compared with related approaches on a new dataset we introduce - namely COFAR.

It offers practical value in applications that need to derive instant new knowledge about new entities in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) with minimal supervision. The challenges mainly come from the few-shot and time shift properties of new entities. First, the limited observations associated with them are insufficient for training a model from scratch. Second, the potentially dynamic distributions from the initially observable facts to the future facts ask for explicitly modeling the evolving characteristics of new entities. We correspondingly propose a novel Meta Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (MetaTKGR) framework. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid neighborhood aggregation schemes to enhance low-data entity representation, MetaTKGR dynamically adjusts the strategies of sampling and aggregating neighbors from recent facts for new entities, through temporally supervised signals on future facts as instant feedback. Besides, such a meta temporal reasoning procedure goes beyond existing meta-learning paradigms on static knowledge graphs that fail to handle temporal adaptation with large entity variance. We further provide a theoretical analysis and propose a temporal adaptation regularizer to stabilize the meta temporal reasoning over time. Empirically, extensive experiments on three real-world TKGs demonstrate the superiority of MetaTKGR over state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.","No"

We additionally propose a simple modification to stabilize the RL training on non-parallel datasets with our induced reward function. Empirical results show that our method outperforms self-training and reward regression methods on several text generation tasks, confirming the effectiveness of our reward function.","No"

This paper studies the time series forecasting problem from a whole new perspective. In the existing methods, the forecasting models take a sequence of numerical values as input and yield numerical values as output. Inspired by the successes of pre-trained language foundation models, we pose a question about whether these models can also be adapted to time series forecasting tasks. Thus, we propose a novel prompt-based time series forecasting (PromptCast) task. In this task, the numerical input and output are transformed into language sentence prompts. We frame the forecasting task in a sentence-to-sentence manner which makes it possible to directly apply language models for the forecasting purpose. To support and facilitate the research of this task, we also present a large-scale dataset (PISA) that includes three real-world forecasting scenarios in this paper. We evaluate different state-of-the-art numerical-based forecasting methods and language generation models such as Bart and Bigbird. The benchmark results demonstrate that the proposed prompt-based time series forecasting with language generation models is a promising research direction. In addition, in comparison to conventional numerical-based forecasting, prompt-based forecasting shows a better generalization ability. We believe that the proposed PromptCast benchmark task as well as our PISA dataset could provide novel insights and further lead to new research directions in the time series forecasting domain.","No"

An information extraction algorithm is proposed which is a combination of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Capsule Networks. Capsule Networks are used to decompose images into their individual features and VAEs are used to explore variations on these decomposed features. Thus, making the model robust in recognizing characteristics from variations of the data.

"Symbol Guided Hindsight Priors for Reward Learning from Human Preferences","Mudit Verma and Katherine Metcalf",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09151","Specifying rewards for reinforcement learned (RL) agents is challenging. Preference-based RL (PbRL) mitigates these challenges by inferring a reward from feedback over sets of trajectories.

We present the PRIor Over Rewards (PRIOR) framework, which incorporates priors about the structure of the reward function and the preference feedback into the reward learning process. Imposing these priors as soft constraints on the reward learning objective reduces the amount of feedback required by half and improves overall reward recovery. Additionally, we demonstrate that using an abstract state space for the computation of the priors further improves the reward learning and the agent's performance.","No"

As AI is being applied to more and more domains, how to efficiently develop high-quality domain-specific language models becomes a critical question in AI software engineering. Existing domain-specific language model development processes mostly focus on learning a domain-specific pre-trained language model (PLM); when training the domain task-specific language model based on PLM, only a direct (and often unsatisfactory) fine-tuning strategy is adopted commonly. By enhancing the task-specific training procedure with domain knowledge graphs, we propose KnowledgeDA, a unified and low-code domain language model development service.

"Natural Logic-guided Autoregressive Multi-hop Document Retrieval for Fact Verification","Rami Aly and Andreas Vlachos",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05276","A key component of fact verification is thevevidence retrieval, often from multiple documents. Recent approaches use dense representations and condition the retrieval of each document on the previously retrieved ones. The latter step is performed over all the documents in the collection, requiring storing their dense representations in an index, thus incurring a high memory footprint. An alternative paradigm is retrieve-and-rerank, where documents are retrieved using methods such as BM25, their sentences are reranked, and further documents are retrieved conditioned on these sentences, reducing the memory requirements. However, such approaches can be brittle as they rely on heuristics and assume hyperlinks between documents. We propose a novel retrieve-and-rerank method for multi-hop retrieval, that consists of a retriever that jointly scores documents in the knowledge source and sentences from previously retrieved documents using an autoregressive formulation and is guided by a proof system based on natural logic that dynamically terminates the retrieval process if the evidence is deemed sufficient. This method is competitive with current state-of-the-art methods on FEVER, HoVer and FEVEROUS-S, while using $5$ to $10$ times less memory than competing systems. Evaluation on an adversarial dataset indicates improved stability of our approach compared to commonly deployed threshold-based methods.

This work explores the potential source that leads to unstable post-hoc explanations. To separate the influence from the model, we propose a simple output probability perturbation method. Compared to prior input side perturbation methods, the output probability perturbation method can circumvent the neural model's potential effect on the explanations and allow the analysis on the explanation method. We evaluate the proposed method with three widely-used post-hoc explanation methods (LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016), Kernel Shapley (Lundberg and Lee, 2017a), and Sample Shapley (Strumbelj and Kononenko, 2010)). The results demonstrate that the post-hoc methods are stable, barely producing discrepant explanations under output probability perturbations.

Traditional approaches usually treat the task as a sequential labeling task, however, this work adopts a slot-filling approach that predicts the presence and type of punctuation marks at each word boundary. The approach is similar to the Masked-Language Model approach employed during the pre-training stages of BERT, but instead of predicting the masked word, our model predicts masked punctuation.

However, these methods still encode biased latent features in representations and neglect the dynamic nature of bias, which hinders model prediction. We propose an NLU debiasing method, named debiasing contrastive learning (DCT), to simultaneously alleviate the above problems based on contrastive learning. We devise a debiasing positive sampling strategy to mitigate biased latent features by selecting the least similar biased positive samples. We also propose a dynamic negative sampling strategy to capture the dynamic influence of biases by employing a bias-only model to dynamically select the most similar biased negative samples. We conduct experiments on three NLU benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that DCT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on out-of-distribution datasets while maintaining in-distribution performance. We also verify that DCT can reduce biased latent features from the model's representations.","No"
"MORTY: Structured Summarization for Targeted Information Extraction from Scholarly Articles","Mohamad Yaser Jaradeh, Markus Stocker, S\'oren Auer",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05429","Information extraction from scholarly articles is a challenging task due to the sizable document length and implicit information hidden in text, figures, and citations. Scholarly information extraction has various applications in exploration, archival, and curation services for digital libraries and knowledge management systems. We present MORTY, an information extraction technique that creates structured summaries of text from scholarly articles. Our approach condenses the article's full-text to property-value pairs as a segmented text snippet called structured summary. We also present a sizable scholarly dataset combining structured summaries retrieved from a scholarly knowledge graph and corresponding publicly available scientific articles, which we openly publish as a resource for the research community. Our results show that structured summarization is a suitable approach for targeted information extraction that complements other commonly used methods such as question answering and named entity recognition.","No"
"End-to-End Speech Translation of Arabic to English Broadcast News","Fethi Bougares and Salim Jouili",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05479","Speech translation (ST) is the task of directly translating acoustic speech signals in a source language into text in a foreign language. ST task has been addressed, for a long time, using a pipeline approach with two modules : first an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in the source language followed by a text-to-text Machine translation (MT). In the past few years, we have seen a paradigm shift towards the end-to-end approaches using sequence-to-sequence deep neural network models. This paper presents our efforts towards the development of the first Broadcast News end-to-end Arabic to English speech translation system. Starting from independent ASR and MT LDC releases, we were able to identify about 92 hours of Arabic audio recordings for which the manual transcription was also translated into English at the segment level. These data was used to train and compare pipeline and end-to-end speech translation systems under multiple scenarios including transfer learning and data augmentation techniques.","No"
"FastClass: A Time-Efficient Approach to Weakly-Supervised Text Classification","Tingyu Xia, Yue Wang, Yuan Tian, Yi Chang",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05506","Weakly-supervised text classification aims to train a classifier using only class descriptions and unlabeled data. Recent research shows that keyword-driven methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. However, these methods not only rely on carefully-crafted class descriptions to obtain class-specific keywords but also require substantial amount of unlabeled data and takes a long time to train. This paper proposes FastClass, an efficient weakly-supervised classification approach. It uses dense text representation to retrieve class-relevant documents from external unlabeled corpus and selects an optimal subset to train a classifier. Compared to keyword-driven methods, our approach is less reliant on initial class descriptions as it no longer needs to expand each class description into a set of class-specific keywords. Experiments on a wide range of classification tasks show that the proposed approach frequently outperforms keyword-driven models in terms of classification accuracy and often enjoys orders-of-magnitude faster training speed.","No"
"Extending TrOCR for Text Localization-Free OCR of Full-Page Scanned Receipt Images","Hongkuan Zhang, Edward Whittaker, Ikuo Kitagishi",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05525","Digitization of scanned receipts aims to extract text from receipt images and save it into structured documents. This is usually split into two sub-tasks: text localization and optical character recognition (OCR). Most existing OCR models only focus on the cropped text instance images, which require the bounding box information provided by a text region detection model. Introducing an additional detector to identify the text instance images in advance is inefficient, however instance-level OCR models have very low accuracy when processing the whole image for the document-level OCR, such as receipt images containing multiple text lines arranged in various layouts. To this end, we propose a localization-free document-level OCR model for transcribing all the characters in a receipt image into an ordered sequence end-to-end. Specifically, we finetune the pretrained Transformer-based instance-level model TrOCR with randomly cropped image chunks, and gradually increase the image chunk size to generalize the recognition ability from instance images to full-page images. In our experiments on the SROIE receipt OCR dataset, the model finetuned with our strategy achieved 64.4 F1-score and a 22.8% character error rates (CER) on the word-level and character-level metrics, respectively, which outperforms the baseline results with 48.5 F1-score and 50.6% CER. The best model, which splits the full image into 15 equally sized chunks, gives 87.8 F1-score and 4.98% CER with minimal additional pre or post-processing of the output. Moreover, the characters in the generated document-level sequences are arranged in the reading order, which is practical for real-world applications.","No"

Objective: To investigate associations between suicide and recent SDOH, identified using structured and unstructured data. Design: Nested case-control study. Setting: EHR data from the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Participants: 6,122,785 Veterans who received care in the US VHA between October 1, 2010, and September 30, 2015. Exposures: Occurrence of SDOH over a maximum span of two years compared with no occurrence of SDOH. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cases of suicide deaths were matched with 4 controls on birth year, cohort entry date, sex, and duration of follow-up. We developed an NLP system to extract SDOH from unstructured notes. Structured data, NLP on unstructured data, and combining them yielded seven, eight and nine SDOH respectively. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Results: In our cohort, 8,821 Veterans committed suicide during 23,725,382 person-years of follow-up (incidence rate 37.18 /100,000 person-years). Our cohort was mostly male (92.23%) and white (76.99%). Across the six common SDOH as covariates, NLP-extracted SDOH, on average, covered 84.38% of all SDOH occurrences. All SDOH, measured by structured data and NLP, were significantly associated with increased risk of suicide. The SDOH with the largest effects was legal problems (aOR=2.67, 95% CI=2.46-2.89), followed by violence (aOR=2.26, 95% CI=2.11-2.43). NLP-extracted and structured SDOH were also associated with suicide. Conclusions and Relevance: NLP-extracted SDOH were always significantly associated with increased risk of suicide among Veterans, suggesting the potential of NLP in public health studies.","No"

Despite the success of large language models and the spontaneous emergence of slang dictionaries, it is unclear how far their combination goes in terms of slang understanding for downstream social good tasks. In this paper, we provide a framework to study different combinations of representation learning models and knowledge resources for a variety of downstream tasks that rely on slang understanding. Our experiments show the superiority of models that have been pre-trained on social media data, while the impact of dictionaries is positive only for static word embeddings. Our error analysis identifies core challenges for slang representation learning, including out-of-vocabulary words, polysemy, variance, and annotation disagreements, which can be traced to characteristics of slang as a quickly evolving and highly subjective language.","No"

Our experiments have been conducted on the ACTER corpus covering four specialized domains (Corruption, Wind energy, Equitation, and Heart failure) and three languages (English, French, and Dutch), and on the RSDO5 Slovenian corpus covering four additional domains (Biomechanics, Chemistry, Veterinary, and Linguistics). The results show that the strategy of employing monolingual models outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches from the related work leveraging multilingual models, regarding all the languages except Dutch and French if the term extraction task excludes the extraction of named entity terms. Furthermore, by combining the outputs of the two best performing models, we achieve significant improvements.","No"

Both have their advantages; discriminative metrics are able to directly optimize for the problem of distinguishing between good and bad outputs, while generative metrics can be trained using abundant raw text. In this paper, we present a framework that combines the best of both worlds, using both supervised and unsupervised signals from whatever data we have available. We operationalize this idea by training T5Score, a metric that uses these training signals with mT5 as the backbone.

Yoo",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05765","Video-grounded Dialogue (VGD) aims to decode an answer sentence to a question regarding a given video and dialogue context. Despite the recent success of multi-modal reasoning to generate answer sentences, existing dialogue systems still suffer from a text hallucination problem, which denotes indiscriminate text-copying from input texts without an understanding of the question. This is due to learning spurious correlations from the fact that answer sentences in the dataset usually include the words of input texts, thus the VGD system excessively relies on copying words from input texts by hoping those words to overlap with ground-truth texts. Hence, we design Text Hallucination Mitigating (THAM) framework, which incorporates Text Hallucination Regularization (THR) loss derived from the proposed information-theoretic text hallucination measurement approach. Applying THAM with current dialogue systems validates the effectiveness on VGD benchmarks (i.e., AVSD@DSTC7 and AVSD@DSTC8) and shows enhanced interpretability.","No"

Specifically, the clients are suggested to first perform local training with the unified tasks assigned by the server rather than using their own learning objectives, which is called the Assign training stage. After that, in the Contrast training stage, clients train with different local learning objectives and exchange knowledge with other clients who contribute consistent and useful model updates.

"P-Transformer: Towards Better Document-to-Document Neural Machine Translation","Yachao Li, Junhui Li, Jing Jiang, Shimin Tao, Hao Yang and Min Zhang",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05830","Directly training a document-to-document (Doc2Doc) neural machine translation (NMT) via Transformer from scratch, especially on small datasets usually fails to converge. Our dedicated probing tasks show that 1) both the absolute position and relative position information gets gradually weakened or even vanished once it reaches the upper encoder layers, and 2) the vanishing of absolute position information in encoder output causes the training failure of Doc2Doc NMT. To alleviate this problem, we propose a position-aware Transformer (P-Transformer) to enhance both the absolute and relative position information in both self-attention and cross-attention. Specifically, we integrate absolute positional information, i.e., position embeddings, into the query-key pairs both in self-attention and cross-attention through a simple yet effective addition operation. Moreover, we also integrate relative position encoding in self-attention. The proposed P-Transformer utilizes sinusoidal position encoding and does not require any task-specified position embedding, segment embedding, or attention mechanism. Through the above methods, we build a Doc2Doc NMT model with P-Transformer, which ingests the source document and completely generates the target document in a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) way. In addition, P-Transformer can be applied to seq2seq-based document-to-sentence (Doc2Sent) and sentence-to-sentence (Sent2Sent) translation. Extensive experimental results of Doc2Doc NMT show that P-Transformer significantly outperforms strong baselines on widely-used 9 document-level datasets in 7 language pairs, covering small-, middle-, and large-scales, and achieves a new state-of-the-art. Experimentation on discourse phenomena shows that our Doc2Doc NMT models improve the translation quality in both BLEU and discourse coherence. We make our code available on Github.","No"

In this study, we investigate three types of Transformer-based models, aiming to address the extreme label set and long text classification challenges that are posed by automated ICD coding tasks. Methods: The Transformer-based model PLM-ICD achieved the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the ICD coding benchmark dataset MIMIC-III. It was chosen as our baseline model to be further optimised. XR-Transformer, the new SOTA model in the general extreme multi-label text classification domain, and XR-LAT, a novel adaptation of the XR-Transformer model, were also trained on the MIMIC-III dataset. XR-LAT is a recursively trained model chain on a predefined hierarchical code tree with label-wise attention, knowledge transferring and dynamic negative sampling mechanisms. Results: Our optimised PLM-ICD model, which was trained with longer total and chunk sequence lengths, significantly outperformed the current SOTA PLM-ICD model, and achieved the highest micro-F1 score of 60.8%. The XR-Transformer model, although SOTA in the general domain, did not perform well across all metrics.

To model the semantic correlation between words and seeds for discovering topic-indicative terms, existing seed-guided approaches utilize different types of context signals, such as document-level word co-occurrences, sliding window-based local contexts, and generic linguistic knowledge brought by pre-trained language models. In this work, we analyze and show empirically that each type of context information has its value and limitation in modeling word semantics under seed guidance, but combining three types of contexts (i.e., word embeddings learned from local contexts, pre-trained language model representations obtained from general-domain training, and topic-indicative sentences retrieved based on seed information) allows them to complement each other for discovering quality topics.

"Large Discourse Treebanks from Scalable Distant Supervision","Patrick Huber and Giuseppe Carenini",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06038","Discourse parsing is an essential upstream task in Natural Language Processing with strong implications for many real-world applications. Despite its widely recognized role, most recent discourse parsers (and consequently downstream tasks) still rely on small-scale human-annotated discourse treebanks, trying to infer general-purpose discourse structures from very limited data in a few narrow domains. To overcome this dire situation and allow discourse parsers to be trained on larger, more diverse and domain-independent datasets, we propose a framework to generate 'silver-standard' discourse trees from distant supervision on the auxiliary task of sentiment analysis.","No"

"Semantic Decomposition Improves Learning of Large Language Models on EHR Data","David A. Bloore, Romane Gauriau, Anna L.

To simplify learning patterns of health and disease, medical codes in EHR can be decomposed into semantic units connected by hierarchical graphs. Building on earlier synergy between Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), we present H-BERT, which ingests complete graph tree expansions of hierarchical medical codes as opposed to only ingesting the leaves and pushes patient-level labels down to each visit. This methodology significantly improves prediction of patient membership in over 500 medical diagnosis classes as measured by aggregated AUC and APS, and creates distinct representations of patients in closely related but clinically distinct phenotypes.","No"

Materials and Methods: We identified 3657 patients diagnosed with MCI together with their progress notes from Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) between 2000-2020. The progress notes no later than the first MCI diagnosis were used for the prediction. We first preprocessed the notes by deidentification, cleaning and splitting, and then pretrained a BERT model for AD (AD-BERT) based on the publicly available Bio+Clinical BERT on the preprocessed notes. The embeddings of all the sections of a patient's notes processed by AD-BERT were combined by MaxPooling to compute the probability of MCI-to-AD progression. For replication, we conducted a similar set of experiments on 2563 MCI patients identified at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) during the same timeframe. Results: Compared with the 7 baseline models, the AD-BERT model achieved the best performance on both datasets, with Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.8170 and F1 score of 0.4178 on NMEDW dataset and AUC of 0.8830 and F1 score of 0.6836 on WCM dataset.

To do this, we extend a dataset that has been previously used to train a binary normative classifier with annotations of moral principles. We then use this dataset to train a variety of machine learning models, evaluate these models and compare their results against humans who were asked to perform the same task.

We make the very first attempt to release a high-quality multi-turn Medical Dialog dataset relating to Covid-19 disease named CDialog, with over 1K conversations collected from the online medical counselling websites. We annotate each utterance of the conversation with seven different categories of medical entities, including diseases, symptoms, medical tests, medical history, remedies, medications and other aspects as additional labels. Finally, we propose a novel neural medical dialog system based on the CDialog dataset to advance future research on developing automated medical dialog systems. We use pre-trained language models for dialogue generation, incorporating annotated medical entities, to generate a virtual doctor's response that addresses the patient's query. Experimental results show that the proposed dialog models perform comparably better when supplemented with entity information and hence can improve the response quality.","No"
"Prompting Is Programming: A Query Language For Large Language Models","Luca Beurer-Kellner, Marc Fischer, Martin Vechev",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06094","Large language models have demonstrated outstanding performance on a wide range of tasks such as question answering and code generation. On a high level, given an input, a language model can be used to automatically complete the sequence in a statistically-likely way. Based on this, users prompt these models with language instructions or examples, to implement a variety of downstream tasks. Advanced prompting methods can even imply interaction between the language model, a user, and external tools such as calculators. However, to obtain state-of-the-art performance or adapt language models for specific tasks, complex task- and model-specific programs have to be implemented, which may still require ad-hoc interaction. Based on this, we present the novel idea of Language Model Programming (LMP). LMP generalizes language model prompting from pure text prompts to an intuitive combination of text prompting and scripting. Additionally, LMP allows constraints to be specified over the language model output. This enables easy adaption to many tasks, while abstracting language model internals and providing high-level semantics. To enable LMP, we implement LMQL (short for Language Model Query Language), which leverages the constraints and control flow from an LMP prompt to generate an efficient inference procedure that minimizes the number of expensive calls to the underlying language model. We show that LMQL can capture a wide range of state-of-the-art prompting methods in an intuitive way, especially facilitating interactive flows that are challenging to implement with existing high-level APIs. Our evaluation shows that we retain or increase the accuracy on several downstream tasks, while also significantly reducing the required amount of computation or cost in the case of pay-to-use APIs (13-85% cost savings).","No"

In this paper, we pursue a modular and explainable architecture for Internet meme understanding. We design and implement multimodal classification methods that perform example- and prototype-based reasoning over training cases, while leveraging both textual and visual SOTA models to represent the individual cases. We study the relevance of our modular and explainable models in detecting harmful memes on two existing tasks: Hate Speech Detection and Misogyny Classification. We compare the performance between example- and prototype-based methods, and between text, vision, and multimodal models, across different categories of harmfulness (e.g., stereotype and objectification). We devise a user-friendly interface that facilitates the comparative analysis of examples retrieved by all of our models for any given meme, informing the community about the strengths and limitations of these explainable methods.","No"

It has been proven to significantly benefit the usage of KGs in many AI applications, such as question answering and recommendation systems, etc. According to the graph types, the existing KGR models can be roughly divided into three categories, \textit{i.e.,} static models, temporal models, and multi-modal models. The early works in this domain mainly focus on static KGR and tend to directly apply general knowledge graph embedding models to the reasoning task. However, these models are not suitable for more complex but practical tasks, such as inductive static KGR, temporal KGR, and multi-modal KGR.

Second, we propose a new hierarchical method, Hi-VT5, based on the T5 architecture, that overcomes the limitations of current methods to process long multi-page documents. The proposed method is based on a hierarchical transformer architecture where the encoder summarizes the most relevant information of every page and then, the decoder takes this summarized information to generate the final answer.

Can we fix the faulty behavior of the RNN by replacing portions associated with the faulty behavior? Recent works on decomposing a fully connected neural network (FCNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) into modules have shown the value of engineering deep models in this manner, which is standard in traditional SE but foreign for deep learning models. However, prior works focus on the image-based multiclass classification problems and cannot be applied to RNN due to (a) different layer structures, (b) loop structures, (c) different types of input-output architectures, and (d) usage of both nonlinear and logistic activation functions. In this work, we propose the first approach to decompose an RNN into modules. We study different types of RNNs, i.e., Vanilla, LSTM, and GRU. Further, we show how such RNN modules can be reused and replaced in various scenarios. We evaluate our approach against 5 canonical datasets (i.e., Math QA, Brown Corpus, Wiki-toxicity, Clinc OOS, and Tatoeba) and 4 model variants for each dataset. We found that decomposing a trained model has a small cost (Accuracy: -0.6%, BLEU score: +0.10%). Also, the decomposed modules can be reused and replaced without needing to retrain.","No"
"Federated NLP in Few-shot Scenarios","Dongqi Cai, Shangguang Wang, Yaozong Wu, Felix Xiaozhu Lin, Mengwei Xu",12,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05974","Natural language processing (NLP) sees rich mobile applications. To support various language understanding tasks, a foundation NLP model is often fine-tuned in a federated, privacy-preserving setting (FL). This process currently relies on at least hundreds of thousands of labeled training samples from mobile clients; yet mobile users often lack willingness or knowledge to label their data. Such an inadequacy of data labels is known as a few-shot scenario; it becomes the key blocker for mobile NLP applications. For the first time, this work investigates federated NLP in the few-shot scenario (FedFSL). By retrofitting algorithmic advances of pseudo labeling and prompt learning, we first establish a training pipeline that delivers competitive accuracy when only 0.05% (fewer than 100) of the training data is labeled and the remaining is unlabeled. To instantiate the workflow, we further present a system FFNLP, addressing the high execution cost with novel designs. (1) Curriculum pacing, which injects pseudo labels to the training workflow at a rate commensurate to the learning progress; (2) Representational diversity, a mechanism for selecting the most learnable data, only for which pseudo labels will be generated; (3) Co-planning of a model's training depth and layer capacity. Together, these designs reduce the training delay, client energy, and network traffic by up to 46.0$\times$, 41.2$\times$ and 3000.0$\times$, respectively. Through algorithm/system co-design, FFNLP demonstrates that FL can apply to challenging settings where most training samples are unlabeled.","No"

Although KD methods achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerous settings, they suffer from several problems limiting their performance. It is shown in the literature that the capacity gap between the teacher and the student networks can make KD ineffective. Additionally, existing KD techniques do not mitigate the noise in the teacher's output: modeling the noisy behaviour of the teacher can distract the student from learning more useful features. We propose a new KD method that addresses these problems and facilitates the training compared to previous techniques. Inspired by continuation optimization, we design a training procedure that optimizes the highly non-convex KD objective by starting with the smoothed version of this objective and making it more complex as the training proceeds. Our method (Continuation-KD) achieves state-of-the-art performance across various compact architectures on NLU (GLUE benchmark) and computer vision tasks (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100).","No"

"Logographic Information Aids Learning Better Representations for Natural Language Inference","Zijian Jin, Duygu Ataman",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02136","Statistical language models conventionally implement representation learning based on the contextual distribution of words or other formal units, whereas any information related to the logographic features of written text are often ignored, assuming they should be retrieved relying on the cooccurence statistics. On the other hand, as language models become larger and require more data to learn reliable representations, such assumptions may start to fall back, especially under conditions of data sparsity. Many languages, including Chinese and Vietnamese, use logographic writing systems where surface forms are represented as a visual organization of smaller graphemic units, which often contain many semantic cues. In this paper, we present a novel study which explores the benefits of providing language models with logographic information in learning better semantic representations. We test our hypothesis in the natural language inference (NLI) task by evaluating the benefit of computing multi-modal representations that combine contextual information with glyph information. Our evaluation results in six languages with different typology and writing systems suggest significant benefits of using multi-modal embeddings in languages with logograhic systems, especially for words with less occurence statistics.","No"

To explore extrapolation to future data points, we further introduce a new data-to-text generation dataset, TempWikiBio, containing more than 4 millions of chronologically ordered revisions of biographical articles from English Wikipedia, each paired with structured personal profiles. Through data-to-text generation on TempWikiBio, text-to-text generation on the content transfer dataset, and summarization on XSum, we show that linear prompts on encoder and textual prompts improve the generation quality on all datasets. Despite having less performance drop when testing on data drawn from a later time, linear prompts focus more on non-temporal information and are less sensitive to the given timestamps, according to human evaluations and sensitivity analyses. Meanwhile, textual prompts establish the association between the given timestamps and the output dates, yielding more factual temporal information in the output.","No"

"CLSE: Corpus of Linguistically Significant Entities","Aleksandr Chuklin, Justin Zhao, Mihir Kale",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02423","One of the biggest challenges of natural language generation (NLG) is the proper handling of named entities. Named entities are a common source of grammar mistakes such as wrong prepositions, wrong article handling, or incorrect entity inflection. Without factoring linguistic representation, such errors are often underrepresented when evaluating on a small set of arbitrarily picked argument values, or when translating a dataset from a linguistically simpler language, like English, to a linguistically complex language, like Russian. However, for some applications, broadly precise grammatical correctness is critical -- native speakers may find entity-related grammar errors silly, jarring, or even offensive. To enable the creation of more linguistically diverse NLG datasets, we release a Corpus of Linguistically Significant Entities (CLSE) annotated by linguist experts. The corpus includes 34 languages and covers 74 different semantic types to support various applications from airline ticketing to video games. To demonstrate one possible use of CLSE, we produce an augmented version of the Schema-Guided Dialog Dataset, SGD-CLSE. Using the CLSE's entities and a small number of human translations, we create a linguistically representative NLG evaluation benchmark in three languages: French (high-resource), Marathi (low-resource), and Russian (highly inflected language). We establish quality baselines for neural, template-based, and hybrid NLG systems and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.","No"
"Dealing with Abbreviations in the Slovenian Biographical Lexicon","Angel Daza, Antske Fokkens, Toma\v{z} Erjavec",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02429","Abbreviations present a significant challenge for NLP systems because they cause tokenization and out-of-vocabulary errors. They can also make the text less readable, especially in reference printed books, where they are extensively used. Abbreviations are especially problematic in low-resource settings, where systems are less robust to begin with. In this paper, we propose a new method for addressing the problems caused by a high density of domain-specific abbreviations in a text. We apply this method to the case of a Slovenian biographical lexicon and evaluate it on a newly developed gold-standard dataset of 51 Slovenian biographies. Our abbreviation identification method performs significantly better than commonly used ad-hoc solutions, especially at identifying unseen abbreviations. We also propose and present the results of a method for expanding the identified abbreviations in context.","No"

"Continuous Prompt Tuning Based Textual Entailment Model for E-commerce Entity Typing","Yibo Wang, Congying Xia, Guan Wang, Philip Yu",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02483","The explosion of e-commerce has caused the need for processing and analysis of product titles, like entity typing in product titles. However, the rapid activity in e-commerce has led to the rapid emergence of new entities, which is difficult to be solved by general entity typing. Besides, product titles in e-commerce have very different language styles from text data in general domain. In order to handle new entities in product titles and address the special language styles problem of product titles in e-commerce domain, we propose our textual entailment model with continuous prompt tuning based hypotheses and fusion embeddings for e-commerce entity typing. First, we reformulate the entity typing task into a textual entailment problem to handle new entities that are not present during training. Second, we design a model to automatically generate textual entailment hypotheses using a continuous prompt tuning method, which can generate better textual entailment hypotheses without manual design. Third, we utilize the fusion embeddings of BERT embedding and CharacterBERT embedding with a two-layer MLP classifier to solve the problem that the language styles of product titles in e-commerce are different from that of general domain. To analyze the effect of each contribution, we compare the performance of entity typing and textual entailment model, and conduct ablation studies on continuous prompt tuning and fusion embeddings. We also evaluate the impact of different prompt template initialization for the continuous prompt tuning. We show our proposed model improves the average F1 score by around 2% compared to the baseline BERT entity typing model.","No"

The backbone of SM2 is Transformer Transducer, which has high streaming capability. Instead of human labeled speech translation (ST) data, SM2 models are trained using weakly supervised data generated by converting the transcriptions in speech recognition corpora with a machine translation service. With 351 thousand hours of anonymized speech training data from 25 languages, SM2 models achieve comparable or even better ST quality than some recent popular large-scale non-streaming speech models. More importantly, we show that SM2 has the truly zero-shot capability when expanding to new target languages, yielding high quality ST results for {source-speech, target-text} pairs that are not seen during training.","No"

This paper mainly tries to use BART and other pre training models, proposes FS2TEXT and RR2TEXT to generate metrical poetry text and even specific style poetry text, and solves the problem that the user's writing intention gradually reduces the relevance of the generated poetry text. In order to test the model's results, the authors selected ancient poets, by combining it with BART's poetic model work, developed a set of AI poetry Turing problems, it was reviewed by a group of poets and poetry writing researchers. There were more than 600 participants, and the final results showed that, high-level poetry lovers can't distinguish between AI activity and human activity, this indicates that the author's working methods are not significantly different from human activities. The model of poetry generation studied by the author generalizes works that cannot be distinguished from those of advanced scholars. The number of modern Chinese poets has reached 5 million. However, many modern Chinese poets lack language ability and skills as a result of their childhood learning. However, many modern poets have no creative inspiration, and the author's model can help them. They can look at this model when they choose words and phrases and they can write works based on the poems they already have, and they can write their own poems. The importance of poetry lies in the author's thoughts and reflections. It doesn't matter how good AI poetry is. The only thing that matters is for people to see and inspire them.","No"
"A Comparison of SVM against Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for Text Classification Tasks","Yasmen Wahba, Nazim Madhavji, John Steinbacher",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02563","The emergence of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has shown great success in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks including text classification. Due to the minimal to no feature engineering required when using these models, PLMs are becoming the de facto choice for any NLP task. However, for domain-specific corpora (e.g., financial, legal, and industrial), fine-tuning a pre-trained model for a specific task has shown to provide a performance improvement. In this paper, we compare the performance of four different PLMs on three public domain-free datasets and a real-world dataset containing domain-specific words, against a simple SVM linear classifier with TFIDF vectorized text. The experimental results on the four datasets show that using PLMs, even fine-tuned, do not provide significant gain over the linear SVM classifier. Hence, we recommend that for text classification tasks, traditional SVM along with careful feature engineering can pro-vide a cheaper and superior performance than PLMs.","No"
"The 'Problem' of Human Label Variation: On Ground Truth in Data, Modeling and Evaluation","Barbara Plank",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02570","Human variation in labeling is often considered noise. Annotation projects for machine learning (ML) aim at minimizing human label variation, with the assumption to maximize data quality and in turn optimize and maximize machine learning metrics. However, this conventional practice assumes that there exists a ground truth, and neglects that there exists genuine human variation in labeling due to disagreement, subjectivity in annotation or multiple plausible answers. In this position paper, we argue that this big open problem of human label variation persists and critically needs more attention to move our field forward. This is because human label variation impacts all stages of the ML pipeline: data, modeling and evaluation. However, few works consider all of these dimensions jointly; and existing research is fragmented. We reconcile different previously proposed notions of human label variation, provide a repository of publicly-available datasets with un-aggregated labels, depict approaches proposed so far, identify gaps and suggest ways forward. As datasets are becoming increasingly available, we hope that this synthesized view on the 'problem' will lead to an open discussion on possible strategies to devise fundamentally new directions.","No"

We propose CLIPBERTScore, a simple weighted combination of CLIPScore and BERTScore to leverage the robustness and strong factuality detection performance between image-summary and document-summary, respectively. Next, due to the lack of meta-evaluation benchmarks to evaluate the quality of multimodal factuality metrics, we collect human judgments of factuality with respect to documents and images. We show that this simple combination of two metrics in the zero-shot setting achieves higher correlations than existing factuality metrics for document summarization, outperforms an existing multimodal summarization metric, and performs competitively with strong multimodal factuality metrics specifically fine-tuned for the task. Our thorough analysis demonstrates the robustness and high correlation of CLIPBERTScore and its components on four factuality metric-evaluation benchmarks. Finally, we demonstrate two practical downstream applications of our CLIPBERTScore metric: for selecting important images to focus on during training, and as a reward for reinforcement learning to improve factuality of multimodal summary generation w.r.t automatic and human evaluation.

Our three-step approach consists of moment proposal, moment-query matching and postprocessing, all using only off-the-shelf models. On the QVHighlights benchmark for VMR, we vastly improve performance of previous zero-shot approaches by at least 2.5x on all metrics and reduce the gap between zero-shot and state-of-the-art supervised by over 74%.

This paper presents a spectral regularization technique, which attaches a unique inductive bias to sequence modeling based on an intuitive concept of simplicity defined in the Chomsky hierarchy. From fundamental connections between Hankel matrices and regular grammars, we propose to use the trace norm of the Hankel matrix, the tightest convex relaxation of its rank, as the spectral regularizer. To cope with the fact that the Hankel matrix is bi-infinite, we propose an unbiased stochastic estimator for its trace norm. Ultimately, we demonstrate experimental results on Tomita grammars, which exhibit the potential benefits of spectral regularization and validate the proposed stochastic estimator.","No"
"Minimum Latency Training of Sequence Transducers for Streaming End-to-End Speech Recognition","Yusuke Shinohara and Shinji Watanabe",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02333","Sequence transducers, such as the RNN-T and the Conformer-T, are one of the most promising models of end-to-end speech recognition, especially in streaming scenarios where both latency and accuracy are important. Although various methods, such as alignment-restricted training and FastEmit, have been studied to reduce the latency, latency reduction is often accompanied with a significant degradation in accuracy. We argue that this suboptimal performance might be caused because none of the prior methods explicitly model and reduce the latency. In this paper, we propose a new training method to explicitly model and reduce the latency of sequence transducer models. First, we define the expected latency at each diagonal line on the lattice, and show that its gradient can be computed efficiently within the forward-backward algorithm. Then we augment the transducer loss with this expected latency, so that an optimal trade-off between latency and accuracy is achieved. Experimental results on the WSJ dataset show that the proposed minimum latency training reduces the latency of causal Conformer-T from 220 ms to 27 ms within a WER degradation of 0.7%, and outperforms conventional alignment-restricted training (110 ms) and FastEmit (67 ms) methods.","No"

Adversarial training and certified robust training have shown some effectiveness in improving the robustness of machine learnt models to fickle adversarial examples. We show that standard adversarial training methods focused on reducing vulnerability to fickle adversarial examples may make a model more vulnerable to obstinate adversarial examples, with experiments for both natural language inference and paraphrase identification tasks. To counter this phenomenon, we introduce Balanced Adversarial Training, which incorporates contrastive learning to increase robustness against both fickle and obstinate adversarial examples.","No"

We find that the neural retriever has much higher performance when fed neural rather than human captions, despite the fact that the former, unlike the latter, were generated without awareness of the distractors that make the task hard. Even more remarkably, when the same neural captions are given to human subjects, their retrieval performance is almost at chance level. Our results thus add to the growing body of evidence that, even when the ``language'' of neural models resembles English, this superficial resemblance might be deeply misleading.","No"

The approach utilizes a specially trained reidentification model to identify individuals from redacted personal documents. Motivated by K-anonymity based privacy, we generate redactions that ensure a minimum reidentification rank for the correct profile of the document. To evaluate this approach, we consider the task of deidentifying Wikipedia Biographies, and evaluate using an adversarial reidentification metric. Compared to a set of unsupervised baselines, our approach deidentifies documents more completely while removing fewer words. Qualitatively, we see that the approach eliminates many identifying aspects that would fall outside of the common named entity based approach.","No"

"Finding Dataset Shortcuts with Grammar Induction","Dan Friedman, Alexander Wettig, Danqi Chen",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11560","Many NLP datasets have been found to contain shortcuts: simple decision rules that achieve surprisingly high accuracy. However, it is difficult to discover shortcuts automatically. Prior work on automatic shortcut detection has focused on enumerating features like unigrams or bigrams, which can find only low-level shortcuts, or relied on post-hoc model interpretability methods like saliency maps, which reveal qualitative patterns without a clear statistical interpretation. In this work, we propose to use probabilistic grammars to characterize and discover shortcuts in NLP datasets. Specifically, we use a context-free grammar to model patterns in sentence classification datasets and use a synchronous context-free grammar to model datasets involving sentence pairs. The resulting grammars reveal interesting shortcut features in a number of datasets, including both simple and high-level features, and automatically identify groups of test examples on which conventional classifiers fail. Finally, we show that the features we discover can be used to generate diagnostic contrast examples and incorporated into standard robust optimization methods to improve worst-group accuracy.","No"

Most notably, humans were able to generate adversarial examples much more effortlessly than automated attacks. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of exactly how humans create these adversarial examples. By exploring the behavioural patterns of human workers during the generation process, we identify statistically significant tendencies based on which words humans prefer to select for adversarial replacement (e.g., word frequencies, word saliencies, sentiment) as well as where and when words are replaced in an input sequence.

"Boosting Natural Language Generation from Instructions with Meta-Learning","Budhaditya Deb, Guoqing Zheng, Ahmed Hassan Awadallah",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11617","Recent work has shown that language models (LMs) trained with multi-task \textit{instructional learning} (MTIL) can solve diverse NLP tasks in zero- and few-shot settings with improved performance compared to prompt tuning. MTIL illustrates that LMs can extract and use information about the task from instructions beyond the surface patterns of the inputs and outputs. This suggests that meta-learning may further enhance the utilization of instructions for effective task transfer. In this paper we investigate whether meta-learning applied to MTIL can further improve generalization to unseen tasks in a zero-shot setting. Specifically, we propose to adapt meta-learning to MTIL in three directions: 1) Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), 2) Hyper-Network (HNet) based adaptation to generate task specific parameters conditioned on instructions, and 3) an approach combining HNet and MAML. Through extensive experiments on the large scale Natural Instructions V2 dataset, we show that our proposed approaches significantly improve over strong baselines in zero-shot settings. In particular, meta-learning improves the effectiveness of instructions and is most impactful when the test tasks are strictly zero-shot (i.e. no similar tasks in the training set) and are 'hard' for LMs, illustrating the potential of meta-learning for MTIL for out-of-distribution tasks.","No"

We find that learning domain-aware representations and adding target-language tags to the encoder leads to effective MDML-NMT.","No"
"Improving Semi-supervised End-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition using CycleGAN and Inter-domain Losses","Chia-Yu Li and Ngoc Thang Vu",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11642","We propose a novel method that combines CycleGAN and inter-domain losses for semi-supervised end-to-end automatic speech recognition. Inter-domain loss targets the extraction of an intermediate shared representation of speech and text inputs using a shared network. CycleGAN uses cycle-consistent loss and the identity mapping loss to preserve relevant characteristics of the input feature after converting from one domain to another. As such, both approaches are suitable to train end-to-end models on unpaired speech-text inputs. In this paper, we exploit the advantages from both inter-domain loss and CycleGAN to achieve better shared representation of unpaired speech and text inputs and thus improve the speech-to-text mapping. Our experimental results on the WSJ eval92 and Voxforge (non English) show 8~8.5% character error rate reduction over the baseline, and the results on LibriSpeech test_clean also show noticeable improvement.","No"

"SLING: Sino Linguistic Evaluation of Large Language Models","Yixiao Song, Kalpesh Krishna, Rajesh Bhatt and Mohit Iyyer",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11689","To understand what kinds of linguistic knowledge are encoded by pretrained Chinese language models (LMs), we introduce the benchmark of Sino LINGuistics (SLING), which consists of 38K minimal sentence pairs in Mandarin Chinese grouped into 9 high-level linguistic phenomena. Each pair demonstrates the acceptability contrast of a specific syntactic or semantic phenomenon (e.g., The keys are lost vs. The keys is lost), and an LM should assign lower perplexity to the acceptable sentence. In contrast to the CLiMP dataset (Xiang et al., 2021), which also contains Chinese minimal pairs and was created by translating the vocabulary of the English BLiMP dataset, the minimal pairs in SLING are derived primarily by applying syntactic and lexical transformations to naturally-occurring, linguist-annotated sentences from the Chinese Treebank 9.0, thus addressing severe issues in CLiMP's data generation process. We test 18 publicly available pretrained monolingual (e.g., BERT-base-zh, CPM) and multi-lingual (e.g., mT5, XLM) language models on SLING. Our experiments show that the average accuracy for LMs is far below human performance (69.7% vs. 97.1%), while BERT-base-zh achieves the highest accuracy (84.8%) of all tested LMs, even much larger ones. Additionally, we find that most LMs have a strong gender and number (singular/plural) bias, and they perform better on local phenomena than hierarchical ones.","No"

Current sequence-to-tree or relation extraction methods regard this only from a fixed view, struggling to simultaneously handle complex semantics and diverse equations. However, human solving naturally involves two consistent reasoning views: top-down and bottom-up, just as math equations also can be expressed in multiple equivalent forms: pre-order and post-order. We propose a multi-view consistent contrastive learning for a more complete semantics-to-equation mapping. The entire process is decoupled into two independent but consistent views: top-down decomposition and bottom-up construction, and the two reasoning views are aligned in multi-granularity for consistency, enhancing global generation and precise reasoning. Experiments on multiple datasets across two languages show our approach significantly outperforms the existing baselines, especially on complex problems. We also show after consistent alignment, multi-view can absorb the merits of both views and generate more diverse results consistent with the mathematical laws.","No"
"Efficiently Tuned Parameters are Task Embeddings","Wangchunshu Zhou and Canwen Xu and Julian McAuley",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11705","Intermediate-task transfer can benefit a wide range of NLP tasks with properly selected source datasets. However, it is computationally infeasible to experiment with all intermediate transfer combinations, making choosing a useful source task a challenging problem. In this paper, we anticipate that task-specific parameters updated in parameter-efficient tuning methods are likely to encode task-specific information. Therefore, such parameters can be predictive for inter-task transferability. Thus, we propose to exploit these efficiently tuned parameters as off-the-shelf task embeddings for the efficient selection of source datasets for intermediate-task transfer. We experiment with 11 text classification tasks and 11 question answering tasks. Experimental results show that our approach can consistently outperform existing inter-task transferability prediction methods while being conceptually simple and computationally efficient. Our analysis also reveals that the ability of efficiently tuned parameters on transferability prediction is disentangled with their in-task performance. This allows us to use parameters from early checkpoints as task embeddings to further improve efficiency.","No"

Previous work focuses on retrieving prototype sentences for the provided concepts to assist generation. They first use a sparse retriever to retrieve candidate sentences, then re-rank the candidates with a ranker. However, the candidates returned by their ranker may not be the most relevant sentences, since the ranker treats all candidates equally without considering their relevance to the reference sentences of the given concepts. Another problem is that re-ranking is very expensive, but only using retrievers will seriously degrade the performance of their generation models. To solve these problems, we propose the metric distillation rule to distill knowledge from the metric (e.g., BLEU) to the ranker. We further transfer the critical knowledge summarized by the distilled ranker to the retriever. In this way, the relevance scores of candidate sentences predicted by the ranker and retriever will be more consistent with their quality measured by the metric. Experimental results on the CommonGen benchmark verify the effectiveness of our proposed method: (1) Our generation model with the distilled ranker achieves a new state-of-the-art result. (2) Our generation model with the distilled retriever even surpasses the previous SOTA.","No"

Most existing works only consider the direct relations or paths between an entity pair. It is considered that such approaches disconnect the semantic connection of multi-relations between an entity pair, and we propose a convolutional and multi-relational representation learning model, ConvMR. The proposed ConvMR model addresses the multi-relation issue in two aspects: (1) Encoding the multi-relations between an entity pair into a unified vector that maintains the semantic connection. (2) Since not all relations are necessary while joining multi-relations, we propose an attention-based relation encoder to automatically assign weights to different relations based on semantic hierarchy. Experimental results on two popular datasets, FB15k-237 and WN18RR, achieved consistent improvements on the mean rank.

In the present study, we examined people's opinions and experiences about micro-mobility in the US and the EU using social media data on Twitter. We made use of topic modeling based on advanced natural language processing techniques and categorized the data into seven topics: promotion and service, mobility, technical features, acceptance, recreation, infrastructure and regulations. Furthermore, using sentiment analysis, we investigated people's positive and negative attitudes towards specific aspects of these topics and compared the patterns of the trends and challenges in the US and the EU. We found that 1) promotion and service included the majority of Twitter discussions in the both regions, 2) the EU had more positive opinions than the US, 3) micro-mobility devices were more widely used for utilitarian mobility and recreational purposes in the EU than in the US, and 4) compared to the EU, people in the US had many more concerns related to infrastructure and regulation issues. These findings help us understand the trends and challenges and prioritize different aspects in micro-mobility to improve their safety and experience across the two areas for designing a more sustainable micro-mobility future.","No"
"Empathetic Dialogue Generation via Sensitive Emotion Recognition and Sensible Knowledge Selection","Lanrui Wang and Jiangnan Li and Zheng Lin and Fandong Meng and Chenxu Yang and Weiping Wang and Jie Zhou",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11715","Empathy, which is widely used in psychological counselling, is a key trait of everyday human conversations. Equipped with commonsense knowledge, current approaches to empathetic response generation focus on capturing implicit emotion within dialogue context, where the emotions are treated as a static variable throughout the conversations. However, emotions change dynamically between utterances, which makes previous works difficult to perceive the emotion flow and predict the correct emotion of the target response, leading to inappropriate response. Furthermore, simply importing commonsense knowledge without harmonization may trigger the conflicts between knowledge and emotion, which confuse the model to choose incorrect information to guide the generation process. To address the above problems, we propose a Serial Encoding and Emotion-Knowledge interaction (SEEK) method for empathetic dialogue generation. We use a fine-grained encoding strategy which is more sensitive to the emotion dynamics (emotion flow) in the conversations to predict the emotion-intent characteristic of response. Besides, we design a novel framework to model the interaction between knowledge and emotion to generate more sensible response. Extensive experiments on EmpatheticDialogues demonstrate that SEEK outperforms the strong baselines in both automatic and manual evaluations.","No"

Despite its extensive use in many applications, like search engines and optical character recognition systems, little has been explored in medical scenarios in which complex and uncommon medical entities are easily misspelled. Correcting the misspellings of medical entities is arguably more difficult than those in the open domain due to its requirements of specificdomain knowledge. In this work, we define the task of Medical-domain Chinese Spelling Correction and propose MCSCSet, a large scale specialist-annotated dataset that contains about 200k samples. In contrast to the existing open-domain CSC datasets, MCSCSet involves: i) extensive real-world medical queries collected from Tencent Yidian, ii) corresponding misspelled sentences manually annotated by medical specialists. To ensure automated dataset curation, MCSCSet further offers a medical confusion set consisting of the commonly misspelled characters of given Chinese medical terms. This enables one to create the medical misspelling dataset automatically. Extensive empirical studies have shown significant performance gaps between the open-domain and medical-domain spelling correction, highlighting the need to develop high-quality datasets that allow for Chinese spelling correction in specific domains. Moreover, our work benchmarks several representative Chinese spelling correction models, establishing baselines for future work.","No"

Unintuitively, our data shows that often target task training data size has minimal effect on how sequential transfer learning performs compared to the same model without transfer learning. Our results lead us to believe that this unexpected result could be due to the effects of catastrophic forgetting, motivating further work into methods that prevent such forgetting.","No"

It is, however, non-trivial because of the sandhi phenomenon that modifies the characters at the word boundaries, and needs special treatment. Existing lexicon driven approaches for SWS make use of Sanskrit Heritage Reader, a lexicon-driven shallow parser, to generate the complete candidate solution space, over which various methods are applied to produce the most valid solution. However, these approaches fail while encountering out-of-vocabulary tokens. On the other hand, purely engineering methods for SWS have made use of recent advances in deep learning, but cannot make use of the latent word information on availability. To mitigate the shortcomings of both families of approaches, we propose Transformer based Linguistically Informed Sanskrit Tokenizer (TransLIST) consisting of (1) a module that encodes the character input along with latent-word information, which takes into account the sandhi phenomenon specific to SWS and is apt to work with partial or no candidate solutions, (2) a novel soft-masked attention to prioritize potential candidate words and (3) a novel path ranking algorithm to rectify the corrupted predictions. Experiments on the benchmark datasets for SWS show that TransLIST outperforms the current state-of-the-art system by an average 7.2 points absolute gain in terms of perfect match (PM) metric.

However, it requires massive task-specific data, which may not be plausible in many real-world applications. Data augmentation methods such as representation interpolation, token replacement, or augmentation with models are applied to tackle this problem. However, these data augmentation methods either potentially cause shifts in decision boundaries (representation interpolation), are not expressive enough (token replacement), or introduce too much computational overhead (augmentation with models). To this end, we propose AugPro (Augmentation with Projection), an effective and efficient data augmentation method for distillation. Our method builds on top of representation interpolation augmentation methods to maintain the diversity of expressions and converts the augmented data to tokens to avoid shifting decision boundaries. It uses simple operations that come with little computational overhead. The results on multiple GLUE tasks show that our methods can improve distillation performance by a large margin at a low time cost.","No"

In this paper, starting from the intuition that discovering intents could be beneficial to the identification of the known intents, we propose a probabilistic framework for discovering intents where intent assignments are treated as latent variables. We adopt Expectation Maximization framework for optimization. Specifically, In E-step, we conduct discovering intents and explore the intrinsic structure of unlabeled data by the posterior of intent assignments. In M-step, we alleviate the forgetting of prior knowledge transferred from known intents by optimizing the discrimination of labeled data.

Yet, counterfactual data generation is costly since it relies on human annotation.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in sentiment classification, using IMDb data for training and other sets for OOD tests (i.e., Amazon, SemEval and Yelp).

"Is Encoder-Decoder Redundant for Neural Machine Translation?","Yingbo Gao, Christian Herold, Zijian Yang, Hermann Ney",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11807","Encoder-decoder architecture is widely adopted for sequence-to-sequence modeling tasks. For machine translation, despite the evolution from long short-term memory networks to Transformer networks, plus the introduction and development of attention mechanism, encoder-decoder is still the de facto neural network architecture for state-of-the-art models. While the motivation for decoding information from some hidden space is straightforward, the strict separation of the encoding and decoding steps into an encoder and a decoder in the model architecture is not necessarily a must. Compared to the task of autoregressive language modeling in the target language, machine translation simply has an additional source sentence as context. Given the fact that neural language models nowadays can already handle rather long contexts in the target language, it is natural to ask whether simply concatenating the source and target sentences and training a language model to do translation would work. In this work, we investigate the aforementioned concept for machine translation. Specifically, we experiment with bilingual translation, translation with additional target monolingual data, and multilingual translation. In all cases, this alternative approach performs on par with the baseline encoder-decoder Transformer, suggesting that an encoder-decoder architecture might be redundant for neural machine translation.","No"

"Spectral Probing","Max M\'uller-Eberstein, Rob van der Goot and Barbara Plank",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11860","Linguistic information is encoded at varying timescales (subwords, phrases, etc.) and communicative levels, such as syntax and semantics. Contextualized embeddings have analogously been found to capture these phenomena at distinctive layers and frequencies. Leveraging these findings, we develop a fully learnable frequency filter to identify spectral profiles for any given task. It enables vastly more granular analyses than prior handcrafted filters, and improves on efficiency. After demonstrating the informativeness of spectral probing over manual filters in a monolingual setting, we investigate its multilingual characteristics across seven diverse NLP tasks in six languages. Our analyses identify distinctive spectral profiles which quantify cross-task similarity in a linguistically intuitive manner, while remaining consistent across languages-highlighting their potential as robust, lightweight task descriptors.","No"
"LittleBird: Efficient Faster & Longer Transformer for Question Answering","Minchul Lee (1), Kijong Han (1), Myeong Cheol Shin (1) ((1) Kakao Enterprise Corp.)",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11870","BERT has shown a lot of sucess in a wide variety of NLP tasks. But it has a limitation dealing with long inputs due to its attention mechanism. Longformer, ETC and BigBird addressed this issue and effectively solved the quadratic dependency problem. However we find that these models are not sufficient, and propose LittleBird, a novel model based on BigBird with improved speed and memory footprint while maintaining accuracy. In particular, we devise a more flexible and efficient position representation method based on Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). We also show that replacing the method of global information represented in the BigBird with pack and unpack attention is more effective. The proposed model can work on long inputs even after being pre-trained on short inputs, and can be trained efficiently reusing existing pre-trained language model for short inputs. This is a significant benefit for low-resource languages where large amounts of long text data are difficult to obtain. As a result, our experiments show that LittleBird works very well in a variety of languages, achieving high performance in question answering tasks, particularly in KorQuAD2.0, Korean Question Answering Dataset for long paragraphs.","No"

One of the very promising approaches is the grapheme Wav2Vec 2.0 model, which uses the self-supervised pretraining approach combined with transfer learning of the fine-tuned speech recognizer. Since it lacks the pronunciation vocabulary and language model, the approach is suitable for tasks where obtaining such models is not easy or almost impossible. In this paper, we use the Wav2Vec speech recognizer in the task of spoken term detection over a large set of spoken documents. The method employs a deep LSTM network which maps the recognized hypothesis and the searched term into a shared pronunciation embedding space in which the term occurrences and the assigned scores are easily computed. The paper describes a bootstrapping approach that allows the transfer of the knowledge contained in traditional pronunciation vocabulary of DNN-HMM hybrid ASR into the context of grapheme-based Wav2Vec. The proposed method outperforms the previously published system based on the combination of the DNN-HMM hybrid ASR and phoneme recognizer by a large margin on the MALACH data in both English and Czech languages.","No"

Concretely, we propose two novel pre-training objectives which respectively explore the context-dependent interactions of NL utterances and SQL queries within each text-to-SQL conversation: (i) schema state tracking (SST) objective that tracks and explores the schema states of context-dependent SQL queries in the form of schema-states by predicting and updating the value of each schema slot during interaction; (ii) utterance dependency tracking (UDT) objective that employs weighted contrastive learning to pull together two semantically similar NL utterances and push away the representations of semantically dissimilar NL utterances within each conversation. In addition, we construct a high-quality large-scale context-dependent text-to-SQL conversation corpus to pre-train STAR. Extensive experiments show that STAR achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two downstream benchmarks (SParC and CoSQL), significantly outperforming previous pre-training methods and ranking first on the leaderboard.

State-of-the-art methodologies operate by maximizing the similarity in representation of names referring to the same concept, and preventing collapse through contrastive learning. However, because biomedical names are not always self-explanatory, it sometimes results in non-semantic representations. BioLORD overcomes this issue by grounding its concept representations using definitions, as well as short descriptions derived from a multi-relational knowledge graph consisting of biomedical ontologies. Thanks to this grounding, our model produces more semantic concept representations that match more closely the hierarchical structure of ontologies. BioLORD establishes a new state of the art for text similarity on both clinical sentences (MedSTS) and biomedical concepts (MayoSRS).","No"

The work is based on the previous approach of using Siamese neural networks for STD and naturally extends it to directly localize a spoken term and estimate its relevance score. The phoneme confusion network generated by a phoneme recognizer is processed by the deep LSTM network which projects each segment of the confusion network into an embedding space. The searched term is projected into the same embedding space using another deep LSTM network. The relevance score is then computed using a simple dot-product in the embedding space and calibrated using a sigmoid function to predict the probability of occurrence. The location of the searched term is then estimated from the sequence of output probabilities. The deep LSTM networks are trained in a self-supervised manner from paired recognition hypotheses on word and phoneme levels. The method is experimentally evaluated on MALACH data in English and Czech languages.","No"

However, MT systems still lack accuracy in some low-resource languages and sometimes make critical translation errors that completely flip the sentiment polarity of the target word or phrase and hence delivers a wrong affect message. This is particularly noticeable in texts that do not follow common lexico-grammatical standards such as the dialectical Arabic (DA) used on online platforms. In this research, we aim to improve the translation of sentiment in UGT written in the dialectical versions of the Arabic language to English. Given the scarcity of gold-standard parallel data for DA-EN in the UGT domain, we introduce a semi-supervised approach that exploits both monolingual and parallel data for training an NMT system initialised by a cross-lingual language model trained with supervised and unsupervised modeling objectives. We assess the accuracy of sentiment translation by our proposed system through a numerical 'sentiment-closeness' measure as well as human evaluation. We will show that our semi-supervised MT system can significantly help with correcting sentiment errors detected in the online translation of dialectical Arabic UGT.","No"
"Turning Fixed to Adaptive: Integrating Post-Evaluation into Simultaneous Machine Translation","Shoutao Guo, Shaolei Zhang, Yang Feng",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11900","Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) starts its translation before reading the whole source sentence and employs either fixed or adaptive policy to generate the target sentence. Compared to the fixed policy, the adaptive policy achieves better latency-quality tradeoffs by adopting a flexible translation policy. If the policy can evaluate rationality before taking action, the probability of incorrect actions will also decrease. However, previous methods lack evaluation of actions before taking them. In this paper, we propose a method of performing the adaptive policy via integrating post-evaluation into the fixed policy. Specifically, whenever a candidate token is generated, our model will evaluate the rationality of the next action by measuring the change in the source content. Our model will then take different actions based on the evaluation results. Experiments on three translation tasks show that our method can exceed strong baselines under all latency.","No"

Using a novel and carefully curated dataset, we show that red-green color-blind speakers use the 'red' and 'green' color terms in less predictable contexts, and in linguistic environments evoking mental image to a lower extent, when compared to their normal-sighted counterparts. These findings shed some new and interesting light on the role of sensory experience on our linguistic system.","No"

In this paper, we propose $m^4Adapter$ (Multilingual Multi-Domain Adaptation for Machine Translation with a Meta-Adapter), which combines domain and language knowledge using meta-learning with adapters. We present results showing that our approach is a parameter-efficient solution which effectively adapts a model to both a new language pair and a new domain, while outperforming other adapter methods. An ablation study also shows that our approach more effectively transfers domain knowledge across different languages and language information across different domains.","No"

These task-oriented dialog systems require a semantic parsing module in order to process user utterances and understand the action to be performed. This semantic parsing component was initially implemented by rule-based or statistical slot-filling approaches for processing simple queries; however, the appearance of more complex utterances demanded the application of shift-reduce parsers or sequence-to-sequence models. While shift-reduce approaches initially demonstrated to be the best option, recent efforts on sequence-to-sequence systems pushed them to become the highest-performing method for that task. In this article, we advance the research on shift-reduce semantic parsing for task-oriented dialog. In particular, we implement novel shift-reduce parsers that rely on Stack-Transformers. These allow to adequately model transition systems on the cutting-edge Transformer architecture, notably boosting shift-reduce parsing performance. Additionally, we adapt alternative transition systems from constituency parsing to task-oriented parsing, and empirically prove that the in-order algorithm substantially outperforms the commonly-used top-down strategy. Finally, we extensively test our approach on multiple domains from the Facebook TOP benchmark, improving over existing shift-reduce parsers and state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence models in both high-resource and low-resource settings.","No"

Evaluating our models on the manifestos of German parties for the 2021 federal election.

More specifically, we compare standard fine-tuning, prompting, and knowledge distillation (KD) when the teacher was trained with either fine-tuning or prompting. Our findings suggest that even though fine-tuning and prompting work well to train large LMs on large train sets, there are more efficient alternatives that can reduce compute or data cost. Interestingly, we find that prompting combined with KD can reduce compute and data cost at the same time.","No"

At the same time, the robustness of these models has also been called into question; recent works have shown that models can rely on shallow patterns in the problem description when predicting a solution. Building on the idea of behavioral testing, we propose a novel framework, which pins down the causal effect of various factors in the input, e.g., the surface form of the problem text, the operands and math operators on the output solution. By grounding the behavioral analysis in a causal graph describing an intuitive reasoning process, we study the behavior of language models in terms of robustness and sensitivity to direct interventions in the input space. We apply our framework on a test bed of bivariate math word problems. Our analysis shows that robustness does not appear to continuously improve as a function of scale, but that the recent LLM, GPT-3-Instruct (175B), achieves a dramatic improvement in both robustness and sensitivity, compared to all other GPT variants.","No"
"Bootstrapping NLP tools across low-resourced African languages: an overview and prospects","C. Maria Keet",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12027","Computing and Internet access are substantially growing markets in Southern Africa, which brings with it increasing demands for local content and tools in indigenous African languages. Since most of those languages are low-resourced, efforts have gone into the notion of bootstrapping tools for one African language from another. This paper provides an overview of these efforts for Niger-Congo B (`Bantu') languages. Bootstrapping grammars for geographically distant languages has been shown to still have positive outcomes for morphology and rules or grammar-based natural language generation. Bootstrapping with data-driven approaches to NLP tasks is difficult to use meaningfully regardless geographic proximity, which is largely due to lexical diversity due to both orthography and vocabulary. Cladistic approaches in comparative linguistics may inform bootstrapping strategies and similarity measures might serve as proxy for bootstrapping potential as well, with both fertile ground for further research.","No"

The emotions of different entities have been considered only partially in emotion semantic role labeling, a task that relates semantic roles to emotion cue words. Proposing a related task, we narrow the focus on the experiencers of events, and assign an emotion (if any holds) to each of them. To this end, we represent each emotion both categorically and with appraisal variables, as a psychological access to explaining why a person develops a particular emotion. On an event description corpus, our experiencer-aware models of emotions and appraisals outperform the experiencer-agnostic baselines, showing that disregarding event participants is an oversimplification for the emotion detection task.","No"

We take a first step in closing this gap by creating a new multimodal task targeted at evaluating understanding of predicate-noun dependencies in a controlled setup. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art models and find that their performance on the task varies considerably, with some models performing relatively well and others at chance level. In an effort to explain this variability, our analyses indicate that the quality (and not only sheer quantity) of pretraining data is essential. Additionally, the best performing models leverage fine-grained multimodal pretraining objectives in addition to the standard image-text matching objectives.

To shed light on this embedding space, we learn a 'query decoder' that, given a latent representation of a neural search engine, generates the corresponding query. We show that it is possible to decode a meaningful query from its latent representation and, when moving in the right direction in latent space, to decode a query that retrieves the relevant paragraph. In particular, the query decoder can be useful to understand 'what should have been asked' to retrieve a particular paragraph from the collection. We employ the query decoder to generate a large synthetic dataset of query reformulations for MSMarco, leading to improved retrieval performance. On this data, we train a pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) T5 model for the application of query suggestion that outperforms both query reformulation and PRF information retrieval baselines.","No"

To this end, we present a novel approach to predict the user's intent (the user speaking to the device or not) directly from acoustic and textual information encoded at subword tokens which are obtained via an end-to-end ASR model. Modeling directly the subword tokens, compared to modeling of the phonemes and/or full words, has at least two advantages: (i) it provides a unique vocabulary representation, where each token has a semantic meaning, in contrast to the phoneme-level representations, (ii) each subword token has a reusable 'sub'-word acoustic pattern (that can be used to construct multiple full words), resulting in a largely reduced vocabulary space than of the full words. To learn the subword representations for the audio-to-intent classification, we extract: (i) acoustic information from an E2E-ASR model, which provides frame-level CTC posterior probabilities for the subword tokens, and (ii) textual information from a pre-trained continuous bag-of-words model capturing the semantic meaning of the subword tokens. The key to our approach is the way it combines acoustic subword-level posteriors with text information using the notion of positional-encoding in order to account for multiple ASR hypotheses simultaneously. We show that our approach provides more robust and richer representations for audio-to-intent classification, and is highly accurate with correctly mitigating 93.3% of unintended user audio from invoking the smart assistant at 99% true positive rate.","No"

"Searching for a higher power in the human evaluation of MT","Johnny Tian-Zheng Wei, Tom Kocmi, and Christian Federmann",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11612","In MT evaluation, pairwise comparisons are conducted to identify the better system. In conducting the comparison, the experimenter must allocate a budget to collect Direct Assessment (DA) judgments. We provide a cost effective way to spend the budget, but show that typical budget sizes often do not allow for solid comparison. Taking the perspective that the basis of solid comparison is in achieving statistical significance, we study the power (rate of achieving significance) on a large collection of pairwise DA comparisons. Due to the nature of statistical estimation, power is low for differentiating less than 1-2 DA points, and to achieve a notable increase in power requires at least 2-3x more samples. Applying variance reduction alone will not yield these gains, so we must face the reality of undetectable differences and spending increases. In this context, we propose interim testing, an 'early stopping' collection procedure that yields more power per judgment collected, which adaptively focuses the budget on pairs that are borderline significant. Interim testing can achieve up to a 27% efficiency gain when spending 3x the current budget, or 18% savings at the current evaluation power.","No"

The present work contributes to this stream of research by using large language models to enhance programming error messages with explanations of the errors and suggestions on how to fix the error. Large language models can be used to create useful and novice-friendly enhancements to programming error messages that sometimes surpass the original programming error messages in interpretability and actionability. These results provide further evidence of the benefits of large language models for computing educators, highlighting their use in areas known to be challenging for students. We further discuss the benefits and downsides of large language models and highlight future streams of research for enhancing programming error messages.","No"
"Diffuser: Efficient Transformers with Multi-hop Attention Diffusion for Long Sequences","Aosong Feng, Irene Li, Yuang Jiang, Rex Ying",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11794","Efficient Transformers have been developed for long sequence modeling, due to their subquadratic memory and time complexity. Sparse Transformer is a popular approach to improving the efficiency of Transformers by restricting self-attention to locations specified by the predefined sparse patterns. However, leveraging sparsity may sacrifice expressiveness compared to full-attention, when important token correlations are multiple hops away. To combine advantages of both the efficiency of sparse transformer and the expressiveness of full-attention Transformer, we propose \textit{Diffuser}, a new state-of-the-art efficient Transformer. Diffuser incorporates all token interactions within one attention layer while maintaining low computation and memory costs. The key idea is to expand the receptive field of sparse attention using Attention Diffusion, which computes multi-hop token correlations based on all paths between corresponding disconnected tokens, besides attention among neighboring tokens. Theoretically, we show the expressiveness of Diffuser as a universal sequence approximator for sequence-to-sequence modeling, and investigate its ability to approximate full-attention by analyzing the graph expander property from the spectral perspective. Experimentally, we investigate the effectiveness of Diffuser with extensive evaluations, including language modeling, image modeling, and Long Range Arena (LRA). Evaluation results show that Diffuser achieves improvements by an average of 0.94% on text classification tasks and 2.30% on LRA, with 1.67$\times$ memory savings compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, which demonstrates superior performance of Diffuser in both expressiveness and efficiency aspects.","No"
"LiteVL: Efficient Video-Language Learning with Enhanced Spatial-Temporal Modeling","Dongsheng Chen, Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11929","Recent large-scale video-language pre-trained models have shown appealing performance on various downstream tasks. However, the pre-training process is computationally expensive due to the requirement of millions of video-text pairs and the redundant data structure of each video. To mitigate these problems, we propose LiteVL, which adapts a pre-trained image-language model BLIP into a video-text model directly on downstream tasks, without heavy pre-training. To enhance the temporal modeling lacking in the image-language model, we propose to add temporal attention modules in the image encoder of BLIP with dynamic temporal scaling. Besides the model-wise adaptation, we also propose a non-parametric pooling mechanism to adaptively reweight the fine-grained video embedding conditioned on the text. Experimental results on text-video retrieval and video question answering show that the proposed LiteVL even outperforms previous video-language pre-trained models by a clear margin, though without any video-language pre-training.","No"
"Neuro-Symbolic Causal Reasoning Meets Signaling Game for Emergent Semantic Communications","Christo Kurisummoottil Thomas and Walid Saad",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12040","Semantic communication (SC) aims to communicate reliably with minimal data transfer while simultaneously providing seamless connectivity to heterogeneous services and users. In this paper, a novel emergent SC (ESC) system framework is proposed and is composed of a signaling game for emergent language design and a neuro-symbolic (NeSy) artificial intelligence (AI) approach for causal reasoning. In order to design the language, the signaling game is solved using an alternating maximization between the communicating node's utilities. The emergent language helps create a context-aware transmit vocabulary (minimal semantic representation) and aids the reasoning process (enabling generalization to unseen scenarios) by splitting complex messages into simpler reasoning tasks for the receiver. The causal description at the transmitter is then modeled (a neural component) as a posterior distribution of the relevant attributes present in the data. Using the reconstructed causal state, the receiver evaluates a set of logical formulas (symbolic part) to execute its task. The nodes NeSy reasoning components are implemented by the recently proposed AI tool called Generative Flow Networks, and they are optimized for higher semantic reliability. The ESC system is designed to enhance the novel metrics of semantic information, reliability, distortion and similarity that are designed using rigorous algebraic properties from category theory thereby generalizing the metrics beyond Shannon's notion of uncertainty. Simulation results validate the ability of ESC to communicate efficiently (with reduced bits) and achieve better semantic reliability than conventional wireless and state-of-the-art systems that do not exploit causal reasoning capabilities.","No"

Then, the phrase that generates the highest variation among the similarity scores is generated, using the same models. The next phrase maximizes the variance subject to being orthogonal, in the latent space, to the highest-variance phrase, and the process continues.

Recent works show that a knowledge graph (KG) can complement text data, offering structured background knowledge that provides a useful scaffold for reasoning. However, these works are not pretrained to learn a deep fusion of the two modalities at scale, limiting the potential to acquire fully joint representations of text and KG. Here we propose DRAGON (Deep Bidirectional Language-Knowledge Graph Pretraining), a self-supervised approach to pretraining a deeply joint language-knowledge foundation model from text and KG at scale. Specifically, our model takes pairs of text segments and relevant KG subgraphs as input and bidirectionally fuses information from both modalities. We pretrain this model by unifying two self-supervised reasoning tasks, masked language modeling and KG link prediction. DRAGON outperforms existing LM and LM+KG models on diverse downstream tasks including question answering across general and biomedical domains, with +5% absolute gain on average.

"Transferring Knowledge via Neighborhood-Aware Optimal Transport for Low-Resource Hate Speech Detection","Tulika Bose, Irina Illina, Dominique Fohr",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09340","The concerning rise of hateful content on online platforms has increased the attention towards automatic hate speech detection, commonly formulated as a supervised classification task. State-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches usually require a substantial amount of labeled resources for training. However, annotating hate speech resources is expensive, time-consuming, and often harmful to the annotators. This creates a pressing need to transfer knowledge from the existing labeled resources to low-resource hate speech corpora with the goal of improving system performance. For this, neighborhood-based frameworks have been shown to be effective. However, they have limited flexibility. In our paper, we propose a novel training strategy that allows flexible modeling of the relative proximity of neighbors retrieved from a resource-rich corpus to learn the amount of transfer. In particular, we incorporate neighborhood information with Optimal Transport, which permits exploiting the geometry of the data embedding space. By aligning the joint embedding and label distributions of neighbors, we demonstrate substantial improvements over strong baselines, in low-resource scenarios, on different publicly available hate speech corpora.","No"

For the Bangla language, the situation is even more challenging and the number of large datasets for NLP research is practically nil. We hereby present Potrika, a large single-label Bangla news article textual dataset curated for NLP research from six popular online news portals in Bangladesh (Jugantor, Jaijaidin, Ittefaq, Kaler Kontho, Inqilab, and Somoyer Alo) for the period 2014-2020. The articles are classified into eight distinct categories (National, Sports, International, Entertainment, Economy, Education, Politics, and Science \& Technology) providing five attributes (News Article, Category, Headline, Publication Date, and Newspaper Source). The raw dataset contains 185.51 million words and 12.57 million sentences contained in 664,880 news articles. Moreover, using NLP augmentation techniques, we create from the raw (unbalanced) dataset another (balanced) dataset comprising 320,000 news articles with 40,000 articles in each of the eight news categories.

(2019) show experimentally that the interpretations of novel English noun compounds (e.g., stew skillet), while not fully compositional, are highly predictable based on whether the modifier and head refer to artifacts or natural kinds. Is the large language model GPT-3 governed by the same interpretive principles? To address this question, we first compare Levin et al.'s experimental data with GPT-3 generations, finding a high degree of similarity. However, this evidence is consistent with GPT3 reasoning only about specific lexical items rather than the more abstract conceptual categories of Levin et al.'s theory. To probe more deeply, we construct prompts that require the relevant kind of conceptual reasoning. Here, we fail to find convincing evidence that GPT-3 is reasoning about more than just individual lexical items. These results highlight the importance of controlling for low-level distributional regularities when assessing whether a large language model latently encodes a deeper theory.","No"

To tackle this, we propose a novel two-way approach that first biases the encoder with attention over a predefined list of rare long-tail and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and then uses dynamic boosting and phone alignment network during decoding to further bias the subword predictions. We evaluate our approach on open-source VoxPopuli and in-house medical datasets to showcase a 60% improvement in F1 score on domain-specific rare words over a strong CTC baseline.","No"

Experiments on three common discourse parsing tasks (News Discourse Profiling, Rhetorical Structure Theory based Discourse Parsing and Penn Discourse Treebank based Discourse Parsing) show that powered by recent pretrained language models, our simplied feature extractors obtain better generalizabilities and meanwhile achieve comparable or even better system performance. The simplified feature extractors have fewer learnable parameters and less processing time.

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), DNNs are often backdoored during the fine-tuning process of a large-scale Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) with poisoned samples. Although the clean weights of PLMs are readily available, existing methods have ignored this information in defending NLP models against backdoor attacks. In this work, we take the first step to exploit the pre-trained (unfine-tuned) weights to mitigate backdoors in fine-tuned language models. Specifically, we leverage the clean pre-trained weights via two complementary techniques: (1) a two-step Fine-mixing technique, which first mixes the backdoored weights (fine-tuned on poisoned data) with the pre-trained weights, then fine-tunes the mixed weights on a small subset of clean data; (2) an Embedding Purification (E-PUR) technique, which mitigates potential backdoors existing in the word embeddings. We compare Fine-mixing with typical backdoor mitigation methods on three single-sentence sentiment classification tasks and two sentence-pair classification tasks and show that it outperforms the baselines by a considerable margin in all scenarios. We also show that our E-PUR method can benefit existing mitigation methods. Our work establishes a simple but strong baseline defense for secure fine-tuned NLP models against backdoor attacks.","No"
"Probing Cross-modal Semantics Alignment Capability from the Textual Perspective","Zheng Ma, Shi Zong, Mianzhi Pan, Jianbing Zhang, Shujian Huang, Xinyu Dai and Jiajun Chen",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09550","In recent years, vision and language pre-training (VLP) models have advanced the state-of-the-art results in a variety of cross-modal downstream tasks. Aligning cross-modal semantics is claimed to be one of the essential capabilities of VLP models. However, it still remains unclear about the inner working mechanism of alignment in VLP models. In this paper, we propose a new probing method that is based on image captioning to first empirically study the cross-modal semantics alignment of VLP models. Our probing method is built upon the fact that given an image-caption pair, the VLP models will give a score, indicating how well two modalities are aligned; maximizing such scores will generate sentences that VLP models believe are of good alignment. Analyzing these sentences thus will reveal in what way different modalities are aligned and how well these alignments are in VLP models. We apply our probing method to five popular VLP models, including UNITER, ROSITA, ViLBERT, CLIP, and LXMERT, and provide a comprehensive analysis of the generated captions guided by these models. Our results show that VLP models (1) focus more on just aligning objects with visual words, while neglecting global semantics; (2) prefer fixed sentence patterns, thus ignoring more important textual information including fluency and grammar; and (3) deem the captions with more visual words are better aligned with images. These findings indicate that VLP models still have weaknesses in cross-modal semantics alignment and we hope this work will draw researchers' attention to such problems when designing a new VLP model.","No"

However, vanilla prompt tuning tends to imitate training corpus characteristics beyond the control attributes, resulting in a poor generalization ability. Moreover, it is less able to capture the relationship between different attributes, further limiting the control performance. In this paper, we propose a new CTG approach, namely DisCup, which incorporates the attribute knowledge of discriminator to optimize the control-prompts, steering a frozen CLM to produce attribute-specific texts. Specifically, the frozen CLM model, capable of producing multitudinous texts, is first used to generate the next-token candidates based on the context, so as to ensure the diversity of tokens to be predicted. Then, we leverage an attribute-discriminator to select desired/undesired tokens from those candidates, providing the inter-attribute knowledge. Finally, we bridge the above two traits by an unlikelihood objective for prompt-tuning. Extensive experimental results show that DisCup can achieve a new state-of-the-art control performance while maintaining an efficient and high-quality text generation, only relying on around 10 virtual tokens.","No"

However, the training of end-to-end methods relies on parallel ST data, which are difficult and expensive to obtain. Fortunately, the supervised data for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) are usually more accessible, making zero-shot speech translation a potential direction. Existing zero-shot methods fail to align the two modalities of speech and text into a shared semantic space, resulting in much worse performance compared to the supervised ST methods. In order to enable zero-shot ST, we propose a novel Discrete Cross-Modal Alignment (DCMA) method that employs a shared discrete vocabulary space to accommodate and match both modalities of speech and text. Specifically, we introduce a vector quantization module to discretize the continuous representations of speech and text into a finite set of virtual tokens, and use ASR data to map corresponding speech and text to the same virtual token in a shared codebook. This way, source language speech can be embedded in the same semantic space as the source language text, which can be then transformed into target language text with an MT module. Experiments on multiple language pairs demonstrate that our zero-shot ST method significantly improves the SOTA, and even performers on par with the strong supervised ST baselines.","No"

Considering the relevance between codes in a large-scale code corpus, the soft-labeled contrastive pre-training can obtain fine-grained soft-labels through an iterative adversarial manner and use them to learn better code representation. The positive sample construction is another key for contrastive pre-training. Previous works use transformation-based methods like variable renaming to generate semantically equal positive codes. However, they usually result in the generated code with a highly similar surface form, and thus mislead the model to focus on superficial code structure instead of code semantics.

"Denoising Enhanced Distantly Supervised Ultrafine Entity Typing","Yue Zhang, Hongliang Fei, Ping Li",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09599","Recently, the task of distantly supervised (DS) ultra-fine entity typing has received significant attention. However, DS data is noisy and often suffers from missing or wrong labeling issues resulting in low precision and low recall. This paper proposes a novel ultra-fine entity typing model with denoising capability. Specifically, we build a noise model to estimate the unknown labeling noise distribution over input contexts and noisy type labels. With the noise model, more trustworthy labels can be recovered by subtracting the estimated noise from the input. Furthermore, we propose an entity typing model, which adopts a bi-encoder architecture, is trained on the denoised data. Finally, the noise model and entity typing model are trained iteratively to enhance each other. We conduct extensive experiments on the Ultra-Fine entity typing dataset as well as OntoNotes dataset and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms other baseline methods.","No"

We participated in the $\mathbf{constrained}$ translation track in which only the data and pretrained models provided by the organizer are allowed. The task is challenging due to three problems, including the absence of training data for some to-be-evaluated language pairs, the uneven optimization of language pairs caused by data imbalance, and the curse of multilinguality. To address these problems, we adopt data augmentation, distributionally robust optimization, and language family grouping, respectively, to develop our multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) models.

"ROSE: Robust Selective Fine-tuning for Pre-trained Language Models","Lan Jiang, Hao Zhou, Yankai Lin, Peng Li, Jie Zhou, Rui Jiang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09658","Even though the large-scale language models have achieved excellent performances, they suffer from various adversarial attacks. A large body of defense methods has been proposed. However, they are still limited due to redundant attack search spaces and the inability to defend against various types of attacks. In this work, we present a novel fine-tuning approach called \textbf{RO}bust \textbf{SE}letive fine-tuning (\textbf{ROSE}) to address this issue. ROSE conducts selective updates when adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks, filtering out invaluable and unrobust updates of parameters. Specifically, we propose two strategies: the first-order and second-order ROSE for selecting target robust parameters. The experimental results show that ROSE achieves significant improvements in adversarial robustness on various downstream NLP tasks, and the ensemble method even surpasses both variants above. Furthermore, ROSE can be easily incorporated into existing fine-tuning methods to improve their adversarial robustness further. The empirical analysis confirms that ROSE eliminates unrobust spurious updates during fine-tuning, leading to solutions corresponding to flatter and wider optima than the conventional method.

"Textual Entailment Recognition with Semantic Features from Empirical Text Representation","Md Atabuzzaman, Md Shajalal, Maksuda Bilkis Baby, Md Rezaul Karim",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09723","Textual entailment recognition is one of the basic natural language understanding(NLU) tasks. Understanding the meaning of sentences is a prerequisite before applying any natural language processing(NLP) techniques to automatically recognize the textual entailment. A text entails a hypothesis if and only if the true value of the hypothesis follows the text. Classical approaches generally utilize the feature value of each word from word embedding to represent the sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to identifying the textual entailment relationship between text and hypothesis, thereby introducing a new semantic feature focusing on empirical threshold-based semantic text representation. We employ an element-wise Manhattan distance vector-based feature that can identify the semantic entailment relationship between the text-hypothesis pair. We carried out several experiments on a benchmark entailment classification(SICK-RTE) dataset. We train several machine learning(ML) algorithms applying both semantic and lexical features to classify the text-hypothesis pair as entailment, neutral, or contradiction. Our empirical sentence representation technique enriches the semantic information of the texts and hypotheses found to be more efficient than the classical ones. In the end, our approach significantly outperforms known methods in understanding the meaning of the sentences for the textual entailment classification task.","No"
"Simultaneous Translation for Unsegmented Input: A Sliding Window Approach","Sukanta Sen and Ond\v{r}ej Bojar and Barry Haddow",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09754","In the cascaded approach to spoken language translation (SLT), the ASR output is typically punctuated and segmented into sentences before being passed to MT, since the latter is typically trained on written text. However, erroneous segmentation, due to poor sentence-final punctuation by the ASR system, leads to degradation in translation quality, especially in the simultaneous (online) setting where the input is continuously updated. To reduce the influence of automatic segmentation, we present a sliding window approach to translate raw ASR outputs (online or offline) without needing to rely on an automatic segmenter. We train translation models using parallel windows (instead of parallel sentences) extracted from the original training data. At test time, we translate at the window level and join the translated windows using a simple approach to generate the final translation. Experiments on English-to-German and English-to-Czech show that our approach improves 1.3--2.0 BLEU points over the usual ASR-segmenter pipeline, and the fixed-length window considerably reduces flicker compared to a baseline retranslation-based online SLT system.","No"

In recent years, researchers have attempted to classify readers with dyslexia based on their eye movements using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). However, these approaches (i) are based on highly aggregated features averaged over all words read by a participant, thus disregarding the sequential nature of the eye movements, and (ii) do not consider the linguistic stimulus and its interaction with the reader's eye movements. In the present work, we propose two simple sequence models that process eye movements on the entire stimulus without the need of aggregating features across the sentence. Additionally, we incorporate the linguistic stimulus into the model in two ways -- contextualized word embeddings and manually extracted linguistic features. The models are evaluated on a Mandarin Chinese dataset containing eye movements from children with and without dyslexia. Our results show that (i) even for a logographic script such as Chinese, sequence models are able to classify dyslexia on eye gaze sequences, reaching state-of-the-art performance, and (ii) incorporating the linguistic stimulus does not help to improve classification performance.","No"

Given translations of a sentence in multiple languages, we create a graph with words as nodes and alignment links as edges by aligning words for all language pairs. We then propagate node labels from source to target using a Graph Neural Network augmented with transformer layers. We show that our propagation creates training sets that allow us to train POS taggers for a diverse set of languages.

This paper explores the use of jointly learnt speech and text representations in a massively multilingual, zero supervised speech, real-world setting to expand the set of languages covered by ASR with only unlabeled speech and text in the target languages. Using the FLEURS dataset, we define the task to cover $102$ languages, where transcribed speech is available in $52$ of these languages and can be used to improve end-to-end ASR quality on the remaining $50$. First, we show that by combining speech representations with byte-level text representations and use of language embeddings, we can dramatically reduce the Character Error Rate (CER) on languages with no supervised speech from 64.8\% to 30.8\%, a relative reduction of 53\%. Second, using a subset of South Asian languages we show that Maestro-U can promote knowledge transfer from languages with supervised speech even when there is limited to no graphemic overlap. Overall, Maestro-U closes the gap to oracle performance by 68.5\% relative and reduces the CER of 19 languages below 15\%.","No"

We propose to select layers based on the variability of their hidden states given a task-specific corpus. We say a layer is already ``well-specialized'' in a task if the within-class variability of its hidden states is low relative to the between-class variability. Our variability metric is cheap to compute and doesn't need any training or hyperparameter tuning. It is robust to data imbalance and data scarcity.

The focus of the present research is the analysis of a large sample of acknowledgement texts indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection. Record types 'article' and 'review' from four different scientific domains, namely social sciences, economics, oceanography and computer science, published from 2014 to 2019 in a scientific journal in English were considered. Six types of acknowledged entities, i.e., funding agency, grant number, individuals, university, corporation and miscellaneous, were extracted from the acknowledgement texts using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) tagger and subsequently examined. A general analysis of the acknowledgement texts showed that indexing of funding information in WoS is incomplete. The analysis of the automatically extracted entities revealed differences and distinct patterns in the distribution of acknowledged entities of different types between different scientific domains. A strong association was found between acknowledged entity and scientific domain and acknowledged entity and entity type. Only negligible correlation was found between the number of citations and the number of acknowledged entities. Generally, the number of words in the acknowledgement texts positively correlates with the number of acknowledged funding organizations, universities, individuals and miscellaneous entities. At the same time, acknowledgement texts with the larger number of sentences have more acknowledged individuals and miscellaneous categories.","No"
"Transfer-learning for video classification: Video Swin Transformer on multiple domains","Daniel Oliveira, David Martins de Matos",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09969","The computer vision community has seen a shift from convolutional-based to pure transformer architectures for both image and video tasks. Training a transformer from zero for these tasks usually requires a lot of data and computational resources. Video Swin Transformer (VST) is a pure-transformer model developed for video classification which achieves state-of-the-art results in accuracy and efficiency on several datasets. In this paper, we aim to understand if VST generalizes well enough to be used in an out-of-domain setting. We study the performance of VST on two large-scale datasets, namely FCVID and Something-Something using a transfer learning approach from Kinetics-400, which requires around 4x less memory than training from scratch. We then break down the results to understand where VST fails the most and in which scenarios the transfer-learning approach is viable. Our experiments show an 85\% top-1 accuracy on FCVID without retraining the whole model which is equal to the state-of-the-art for the dataset and a 21\% accuracy on Something-Something. The experiments also suggest that the performance of the VST decreases on average when the video duration increases which seems to be a consequence of a design choice of the model. From the results, we conclude that VST generalizes well enough to classify out-of-domain videos without retraining when the target classes are from the same type as the classes used to train the model. We observed this effect when we performed transfer-learning from Kinetics-400 to FCVID, where most datasets target mostly objects. On the other hand, if the classes are not from the same type, then the accuracy after the transfer-learning approach is expected to be poor. We observed this effect when we performed transfer-learning from Kinetics-400, where the classes represent mostly objects, to Something-Something, where the classes represent mostly actions.","No"

"Linear Guardedness and its Implications","Shauli Ravfogel, Yoav Goldberg, Ryan Cotterell",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10012","Previous work on concept identification in neural representations has focused on linear concept subspaces and their neutralization. In this work, we formulate the notion of linear guardedness -- the inability to directly predict a given concept from the representation -- and study its implications. We show that, in the binary case, the neutralized concept cannot be recovered by an additional linear layer. However, we point out that -- contrary to what was implicitly argued in previous works -- multiclass softmax classifiers can be constructed that indirectly recover the concept. Thus, linear guardedness does not guarantee that linear classifiers do not utilize the neutralized concepts, shedding light on theoretical limitations of linear information removal methods.","No"
"ULN: Towards Underspecified Vision-and-Language Navigation","Weixi Feng, Tsu-Jui Fu, Yujie Lu, William Yang Wang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10020","Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a task to guide an embodied agent moving to a target position using language instructions. Despite the significant performance improvement, the wide use of fine-grained instructions fails to characterize more practical linguistic variations in reality. To fill in this gap, we introduce a new setting, namely Underspecified vision-and-Language Navigation (ULN), and associated evaluation datasets. ULN evaluates agents using multi-level underspecified instructions instead of purely fine-grained or coarse-grained, which is a more realistic and general setting. As a primary step toward ULN, we propose a VLN framework that consists of a classification module, a navigation agent, and an Exploitation-to-Exploration (E2E) module. Specifically, we propose to learn Granularity Specific Sub-networks (GSS) for the agent to ground multi-level instructions with minimal additional parameters. Then, our E2E module estimates grounding uncertainty and conducts multi-step lookahead exploration to improve the success rate further. Experimental results show that existing VLN models are still brittle to multi-level language underspecification. Our framework is more robust and outperforms the baselines on ULN by ~10% relative success rate across all levels.","No"
"Alzheimer's Diagnosis and Generation-Based Chatbot Using Hierarchical Attention and Transformer","Park Jun Yeong, Shin Su Jong, Choi Chang Hwan, Lee Jung Jae, Choi Sang-il",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07703","In this paper, we propose a natural language processing architecture that can handle tasks that previously required two models as one model. With a single model, we analyze the language patterns and conversational context of Alzheimer's patients and derive answers from two results: patient classification and chatbot. If the patient's language characteristics are identified by chatbots in daily life, doctors can plan more precise diagnosis and treatment for early diagnosis. The proposed model is used to develop chatbots that replace questionnaires that required experts. There are two natural language processing tasks performed by the model. The first is a 'natural language classification' that indicates with probability whether the patient has an illness, and the second is to generate the next 'answer' of the chatbot to the patient's answer. In the first half, a context vector, which is a characteristic of patient utterance, is extracted through a self-attention neural network. This context vector and chatbot (expert, moderator) questions are entered together into the encoder to obtain a matrix containing the characteristics of the interaction between the questioner and the patient. The vectorized matrix becomes a probability value for classification of patients. Enter the matrix into the decoder with the next answer from the chatbot (the moderator) to generate the next utterance. As a result of learning this structure with DmentiaBank's cookie theft description corpus, it was confirmed that the value of the loss function of the encoder and decoder was significantly reduced and converged. This shows that capturing the speech language pattern of Alzheimer's disease patients can contribute to early diagnosis and longitudinal studies of the disease in the future.","No"
"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Construction Cost Documents into the International Construction Measurement Standard","J. Ignacio Deza, Hisham Ihshaish and Lamine Mahdjoubi",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07705","We introduce the first automated models for classifying natural language descriptions provided in cost documents called 'Bills of Quantities' (BoQs) popular in the infrastructure construction industry, into the International Construction Measurement Standard (ICMS). The models we deployed and systematically evaluated for multi-class text classification are learnt from a dataset of more than 50 thousand descriptions of items retrieved from 24 large infrastructure construction projects across the United Kingdom. We describe our approach to language representation and subsequent modelling to examine the strength of contextual semantics and temporal dependency of language used in construction project documentation. To do that we evaluate two experimental pipelines to inferring ICMS codes from text, on the basis of two different language representation models and a range of state-of-the-art sequence-based classification methods, including recurrent and convolutional neural network architectures. The findings indicate a highly effective and accurate ICMS automation model is within reach, with reported accuracy results above 90% F1 score on average, on 32 ICMS categories. Furthermore, due to the specific nature of language use in the BoQs text; short, largely descriptive and technical, we find that simpler models compare favourably to achieving higher accuracy results. Our analysis suggest that information is more likely embedded in local key features in the descriptive text, which explains why a simpler generic temporal convolutional network (TCN) exhibits comparable memory to recurrent architectures with the same capacity, and subsequently outperforms these at this task.","No"
"Incongruity Detection between Bangla News Headline and Body Content through Graph Neural Network","Md Aminul Haque Palash, Akib Khan, Kawsarul Islam, MD Abdullah Al Nasim, Ryan Mohammad Bin Shahjahan",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07709","Incongruity between news headlines and the body content is a common method of deception used to attract readers. Profitable headlines pique readers' interest and encourage them to visit a specific website. This is usually done by adding an element of dishonesty, using enticements that do not precisely reflect the content being delivered. As a result, automatic detection of incongruent news between headline and body content using language analysis has gained the research community's attention. However, various solutions are primarily being developed for English to address this problem, leaving low-resource languages out of the picture. Bangla is ranked 7th among the top 100 most widely spoken languages, which motivates us to pay special attention to the Bangla language. Furthermore, Bangla has a more complex syntactic structure and fewer natural language processing resources, so it becomes challenging to perform NLP tasks like incongruity detection and stance detection. To tackle this problem, for the Bangla language, we offer a graph-based hierarchical dual encoder (BGHDE) model that learns the content similarity and contradiction between Bangla news headlines and content paragraphs effectively. The experimental results show that the proposed Bangla graph-based neural network model achieves above 90% accuracy on various Bangla news datasets.","No"

"Multilevel Transformer For Multimodal Emotion Recognition","Junyi He, Meimei Wu, Meng Li, Xiaobo Zhu, Feng Ye",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07711","Multimodal emotion recognition has attracted much attention recently. Fusing multiple modalities effectively with limited labeled data is a challenging task. Considering the success of pre-trained model and fine-grained nature of emotion expression, it is reasonable to take these two aspects into consideration. Unlike previous methods that mainly focus on one aspect, we introduce a novel multi-granularity framework, which combines fine-grained representation with pre-trained utterance-level representation. Inspired by Transformer TTS, we propose a multilevel transformer model to perform fine-grained multimodal emotion recognition. Specifically, we explore different methods to incorporate phoneme-level embedding with word-level embedding. To perform multi-granularity learning, we simply combine multilevel transformer model with Albert. Extensive experimental results show that both our multilevel transformer model and multi-granularity model outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on IEMOCAP dataset with text transcripts and speech signal.","No"

However, the applicability of these methods to real clinical use cases is hindered, due to the limitation of pre-trained LMs in processing long textual data with thousands of words, which is a common length for a clinical note. In this work, we explore long-range adaptation from such LMs with Longformer, allowing the LMs to capture longer clinical notes context. We conduct experiments on three n2c2 challenges datasets and a longitudinal clinical dataset from Hong Kong Hospital Authority electronic health record (EHR) system to show the effectiveness and generalizability of this concept, achieving 10\% F1-score improvement.

However, there is a debate on whether attention weights can, in fact, be used to identify the most important inputs to a model. We approach this question from an information theoretic perspective by measuring the mutual information between the model output and the hidden states. From extensive experiments, we draw the following conclusions: (i) Additive and Deep attention mechanisms are likely to be better at preserving the information between the hidden states and the model output (compared to Scaled Dot-product); (ii) ablation studies indicate that Additive attention can actively learn to explain the importance of its input hidden representations; (iii) when attention values are nearly the same, the rank order of attention values is not consistent with the rank order of the mutual information(iv) Using Gumbel-Softmax with a temperature lower than one, tends to produce a more skewed attention score distribution compared to softmax and hence is a better choice for explainable design; (v) some building blocks are better at preserving the correlation between the ordered list of mutual information and attention weights order (for e.g., the combination of BiLSTM encoder and Additive attention). Our findings indicate that attention mechanisms do have the potential to function as a shortcut to model explanations when they are carefully combined with other model elements.","No"

However, these compression techniques require specialized software to apply and deploy at scale. In this work, we propose a new pipeline for creating and running Fast Transformer models on CPUs, utilizing hardware-aware pruning, knowledge distillation, quantization, and our own Transformer inference runtime engine with optimized kernels for sparse and quantized operators. We demonstrate the efficiency of our pipeline by creating a Fast DistilBERT model showing minimal accuracy loss on the question-answering SQuADv1.1 benchmark, and throughput results under typical production constraints and environments.

Our model uses a Depression Symptoms Detection (DSD) model, which is trained on the largest existing samples of clinician annotated tweets for clinical depression symptoms. We subsequently use our DSD model to extract clinically relevant features, e.g., depression scores and their consequent temporal patterns, as well as user posting activity patterns, e.g., quantifying their ``no activity'' or ``silence.'' Furthermore, to evaluate the efficacy of these extracted features, we create three kinds of datasets including a test dataset, from two existing well-known benchmark datasets for user-level depression detection. We then provide accuracy measures based on single features, baseline features and feature ablation tests, at several different levels of temporal granularity, data distributions, and clinical depression detection related settings to draw a complete picture of the impact of these features across our created datasets. Finally, we show that, in general, only semantic oriented representation models perform well. However, clinical features may enhance overall performance provided that the training and testing distribution is similar, and there is more data in a user's timeline. Further, we show that the predictive capability of depression scores increase significantly while used in a more sensitive clinical depression detection settings.","No"

Do the models exhibit random and thus potentially harmful beliefs in certain languages? Both these issues could negatively impact cross-lingual transfer and potentially lead to harmful outcomes. In this paper, we (1) apply the MoralDirection framework to multilingual models, comparing results in German, Czech, Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, and English, (2) analyse model behaviour on filtered parallel subtitles corpora, and (3) apply the models to a Moral Foundations Questionnaire, comparing with human responses from different countries. Our experiments demonstrate that, indeed, PMLMs encode differing moral biases, but these do not necessarily correspond to cultural differences or commonalities in human opinions.","No"

However, these models struggle with implicit sentiment expressions, which are commonly observed in opinionated content such as online reviews. In this work, we introduce GEN-SCL-NAT, which consists of two techniques for improved structured generation for ACOS quadruple extraction. First, we propose GEN-SCL, a supervised contrastive learning objective that aids quadruple prediction by encouraging the model to produce input representations that are discriminable across key input attributes, such as sentiment polarity and the existence of implicit opinions and aspects. Second, we introduce GEN-NAT, a new structured generation format that better adapts autoregressive encoder-decoder models to extract quadruples in a generative fashion.

The major challenge impeding progress in this domain is the lack of adequate child speech corpora; however, recent advances in self-supervised learning have created a new opportunity for overcoming this problem of data scarcity. In this paper, we leverage self-supervised adult speech representations and use three well-known child speech corpora to build models for children's speech recognition. We assess the performance of fine-tuning on both native and non-native children's speech, examine the effect of cross-domain child corpora, and investigate the minimum amount of child speech required to fine-tune a model which outperforms a state-of-the-art adult model. We also analyze speech recognition performance across children's ages. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning with cross-domain child corpora leads to relative improvements of up to 46.08% and 45.53% for native and non-native child speech respectively, and absolute improvements of 14.70% and 31.10%.

We study each adaptation strategy separately, as well as the combined performance improvement through ablation experiments and an extensive set of evaluations run over seven adaptation domains.

Our approach trains two models: a discriminative parser based on a bracketing transduction grammar whose derivation tree hierarchically aligns source and target phrases, and a neural seq2seq model that learns to translate the aligned phrases one-by-one. We use the same seq2seq model to translate at all phrase scales, which results in two inference modes: one mode in which the parser is discarded and only the seq2seq component is used at the sequence-level, and another in which the parser is combined with the seq2seq model. Decoding in the latter mode is done with the cube-pruned CKY algorithm, which is more involved but can make use of new translation rules during inference. We formalize our model as a source-conditioned synchronous grammar and develop an efficient variational inference algorithm for training. When applied on top of both randomly initialized and pretrained seq2seq models, we find that both inference modes performs well compared to baselines on small scale machine translation benchmarks.","No"

Throughout this analysis, we use data augmentation techniques, data re-sampling, and class-weights with Transformer-based Pretrained Language Models(PLMs) to handle the imbalance problem of these datasets. Moreover, feature selection is used to enhance the models' performance by emphasizing the text's specific features. In addition, we provide a new policy for selecting data from EmoPars, which selects the high-confidence samples; as a result, the model does not see samples that do not have specific emotion during training. Our model reaches a Macro-averaged F1-score of 0.81 and 0.76 on ArmanEmo and EmoPars, respectively, which are new state-of-the-art results in these benchmarks.","No"
"Multilingual and Multimodal Topic Modelling with Pretrained Embeddings","Elaine Zosa and Lidia Pivovarova",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08057","This paper presents M3L-Contrast -- a novel multimodal multilingual (M3L) neural topic model for comparable data that maps texts from multiple languages and images into a shared topic space. Our model is trained jointly on texts and images and takes advantage of pretrained document and image embeddings to abstract the complexities between different languages and modalities. As a multilingual topic model, it produces aligned language-specific topics and as multimodal model, it infers textual representations of semantic concepts in images. We demonstrate that our model is competitive with a zero-shot topic model in predicting topic distributions for comparable multilingual data and significantly outperforms a zero-shot model in predicting topic distributions for comparable texts and images. We also show that our model performs almost as well on unaligned embeddings as it does on aligned embeddings.","No"

However, currently, the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization becomes a generally ill-posed problem, even for the large-scale PLMs in natural language understanding tasks, which prevents the deployment of NLP methods in the real world. To facilitate the research in this direction, this paper makes the first attempt to establish a unified benchmark named GLUE-X, highlighting the importance of OOD robustness and providing insights on how to measure the robustness of a model and how to improve it. To this end, we collect 13 publicly available datasets as OOD test data, and conduct evaluations on 8 classic NLP tasks over \emph{18} popularly used models. Our findings confirm that the OOD accuracy in NLP tasks needs to be paid more attention to since the significant performance decay compared to ID accuracy has been found in all settings.","No"
"A Universal Discriminator for Zero-Shot Generalization","Haike Xu, Zongyu Lin, Jing Zhou, Yanan Zheng, Zhilin Yang",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08099","Generative modeling has been the dominant approach for large-scale pretraining and zero-shot generalization. In this work, we challenge this convention by showing that discriminative approaches perform substantially better than generative ones on a large number of NLP tasks. Technically, we train a single discriminator to predict whether a text sample comes from the true data distribution, similar to GANs. Since many NLP tasks can be formulated as selecting from a few options, we use this discriminator to predict the option with the highest probability. This simple formulation achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot results on the T0 benchmark, outperforming T0 by 16.0\%, 7.8\%, and 11.5\% respectively on different scales. In the finetuning setting, our approach also achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of NLP tasks, with only 1/4 parameters of previous methods. Meanwhile, our approach requires minimal prompting efforts, which largely improves robustness and is essential for real-world applications. Furthermore, we also jointly train a generalized UD in combination with generative tasks, which maintains its advantage on discriminative tasks and simultaneously works on generative tasks.","No"
"Hierarchical Pronunciation Assessment with Multi-Aspect Attention","Heejin Do, Yunsu Kim, Gary Geunbae Lee",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08102","Automatic pronunciation assessment is a major component of a computer-assisted pronunciation training system. To provide in-depth feedback, scoring pronunciation at various levels of granularity such as phoneme, word, and utterance, with diverse aspects such as accuracy, fluency, and completeness, is essential. However, existing multi-aspect multi-granularity methods simultaneously predict all aspects at all granularity levels; therefore, they have difficulty in capturing the linguistic hierarchy of phoneme, word, and utterance. This limitation further leads to neglecting intimate cross-aspect relations at the same linguistic unit. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Pronunciation Assessment with Multi-aspect Attention (HiPAMA) model, which hierarchically represents the granularity levels to directly capture their linguistic structures and introduces multi-aspect attention that reflects associations across aspects at the same level to create more connotative representations. By obtaining relational information from both the granularity- and aspect-side, HiPAMA can take full advantage of multi-task learning. Remarkable improvements in the experimental results on the speachocean762 datasets demonstrate the robustness of HiPAMA, particularly in the difficult-to-assess aspects.","No"

"An Efficient Active Learning Pipeline for Legal Text Classification","Sepideh Mamooler and R\'emi Lebret and St\'ephane Massonnet and Karl Aberer",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08112","Active Learning (AL) is a powerful tool for learning with less labeled data, in particular, for specialized domains, like legal documents, where unlabeled data is abundant, but the annotation requires domain expertise and is thus expensive. Recent works have shown the effectiveness of AL strategies for pre-trained language models. However, most AL strategies require a set of labeled samples to start with, which is expensive to acquire. In addition, pre-trained language models have been shown unstable during fine-tuning with small datasets, and their embeddings are not semantically meaningful. In this work, we propose a pipeline for effectively using active learning with pre-trained language models in the legal domain. To this end, we leverage the available unlabeled data in three phases. First, we continue pre-training the model to adapt it to the downstream task. Second, we use knowledge distillation to guide the model's embeddings to a semantically meaningful space. Finally, we propose a simple, yet effective, strategy to find the initial set of labeled samples with fewer actions compared to existing methods. Our experiments on Contract-NLI, adapted to the classification task, and LEDGAR benchmarks show that our approach outperforms standard AL strategies, and is more efficient. Furthermore, our pipeline reaches comparable results to the fully-supervised approach with a small performance gap, and dramatically reduced annotation cost. Code and the adapted data will be made available.","No"

Because mathematical notation is precise and its meaning changes significantly with small character shifts, the methods that work for natural text do not necessarily work well for mathematical expressions. In this work, we describe an approach for representing mathematical expressions in a continuous vector space. We use the encoder of a sequence-to-sequence architecture, trained on visually different but mathematically equivalent expressions, to generate vector representations (embeddings). We compare this approach with an autoencoder and show that the former is better at capturing mathematical semantics. Finally, to expedite future projects, we publish a corpus of equivalent transcendental and algebraic expression pairs.","No"
"CSynGEC: Incorporating Constituent-based Syntax for Grammatical Error Correction with a Tailored GEC-Oriented Parser","Yue Zhang, Zhenghua Li",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08158","Recently, Zhang et al. (2022) propose a syntax-aware grammatical error correction (GEC) approach, named SynGEC, showing that incorporating tailored dependency-based syntax of the input sentence is quite beneficial to GEC. This work considers another mainstream syntax formalism, i.e., constituent-based syntax. By drawing on the successful experience of SynGEC, we first propose an extended constituent-based syntax scheme to accommodate errors in ungrammatical sentences. Then, we automatically obtain constituency trees of ungrammatical sentences to train a GEC-oriented constituency parser by using parallel GEC data as a pivot. For syntax encoding, we employ the graph convolutional network (GCN). Experimental results show that our method, named CSynGEC, yields substantial improvements over strong baselines. Moreover, we investigate the integration of constituent-based and dependency-based syntax for GEC in two ways: 1) intra-model combination, which means using separate GCNs to encode both kinds of syntax for decoding in a single model; 2)inter-model combination, which means gathering and selecting edits predicted by different models to achieve final corrections. We find that the former method improves recall over using one standalone syntax formalism while the latter improves precision, and both lead to better F0.5 values.","No"
"Type Information Utilized Event Detection via Multi-Channel GNNs in Electrical Power Systems","Qian Li, Jianxin Li, Lihong Wang, Cheng Ji, Yiming Hei, Jiawei Sheng, Qingyun Sun, Shan Xue, Pengtao Xie",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08168","Event detection in power systems aims to identify triggers and event types, which helps relevant personnel respond to emergencies promptly and facilitates the optimization of power supply strategies. However, the limited length of short electrical record texts causes severe information sparsity, and numerous domain-specific terminologies of power systems makes it difficult to transfer knowledge from language models pre-trained on general-domain texts. Traditional event detection approaches primarily focus on the general domain and ignore these two problems in the power system domain. To address the above issues, we propose a Multi-Channel graph neural network utilizing Type information for Event Detection in power systems, named MC-TED, leveraging a semantic channel and a topological channel to enrich information interaction from short texts. Concretely, the semantic channel refines textual representations with semantic similarity, building the semantic information interaction among potential event-related words. The topological channel generates a relation-type-aware graph modeling word dependencies, and a word-type-aware graph integrating part-of-speech tags. To further reduce errors worsened by professional terminologies in type analysis, a type learning mechanism is designed for updating the representations of both the word type and relation type in the topological channel. In this way, the information sparsity and professional term occurrence problems can be alleviated by enabling interaction between topological and semantic information. Furthermore, to address the lack of labeled data in power systems, we built a Chinese event detection dataset based on electrical Power Event texts, named PoE. In experiments, our model achieves compelling results not only on the PoE dataset, but on general-domain event detection datasets including ACE 2005 and MAVEN.","No"

Such language models are first pre-trained on gigantic corpora of text and later used as base-model for finetuning on a particular task. Since the pre-training step is usually not repeated, base models are not up-to-date with the latest information. In this paper, we update RobBERT, a RoBERTa-based state-of-the-art Dutch language model, which was trained in 2019. First, the tokenizer of RobBERT is updated to include new high-frequent tokens present in the latest Dutch OSCAR corpus, e.g. corona-related words. Then we further pre-train the RobBERT model using this dataset. To evaluate if our new model is a plug-in replacement for RobBERT, we introduce two additional criteria based on concept drift of existing tokens and alignment for novel tokens.We found that for certain language tasks this update results in a significant performance increase. These results highlight the benefit of continually updating a language model to account for evolving language use.","No"

However, little has been studied about this phenomenon and its effects on downstream tasks. In the present work, we systematically study the association between frequency and semantic similarity in several static word embeddings. We find that Skip-gram, GloVe and FastText embeddings tend to produce higher semantic similarity between high-frequency words than between other frequency combinations. We show that the association between frequency and similarity also appears when words are randomly shuffled. This proves that the patterns found are not due to real semantic associations present in the texts, but are an artifact produced by the word embeddings. Finally, we provide an example of how word frequency can strongly impact the measurement of gender bias with embedding-based metrics. In particular, we carry out a controlled experiment that shows that biases can even change sign or reverse their order by manipulating word frequencies.","No"

A core problem of LJP is how to distinguish confusing legal cases, where only subtle text differences exist. Previous studies fail to distinguish different classification errors with a standard cross-entropy classification loss, and ignore the numbers in the fact description for predicting the term of penalty. To tackle these issues, in this work, first, we propose a moco-based supervised contrastive learning to learn distinguishable representations, and explore the best strategy to construct positive example pairs to benefit all three subtasks of LJP simultaneously. Second, in order to exploit the numbers in legal cases for predicting the penalty terms of certain cases, we further enhance the representation of the fact description with extracted crime amounts which are encoded by a pre-trained numeracy model. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results, especially on confusing legal cases.

Such annotated datasets however are difficult and costly to collect, and rarely exist in languages other than English, rendering QA technology inaccessible to underrepresented languages. An alternative to building large monolingual training datasets is to leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) under a few-shot learning setting. Our approach, QAmeleon, uses a PLM to automatically generate multilingual data upon which QA models are trained, thus avoiding costly annotation. Prompt tuning the PLM for data synthesis with only five examples per language delivers accuracy superior to translation-based baselines, bridges nearly 60% of the gap between an English-only baseline and a fully supervised upper bound trained on almost 50,000 hand labeled examples, and always leads to substantial improvements compared to fine-tuning a QA model directly on labeled examples in low resource settings.

In e-commerce, understanding users' needs or intentions requires substantial commonsense knowledge, e.g., ``A user bought an iPhone and a compatible case because the user wanted the phone to be protected''. In this paper, we present FolkScope, an intention knowledge graph construction framework, to reveal the structure of humans' minds about purchasing items on e-commerce platforms such as Amazon. As commonsense knowledge is usually ineffable and not expressed explicitly, it is challenging to perform any kind of information extraction. Thus, we propose a new approach that leverages the generation power of large-scale language models and human-in-the-loop annotations to semi-automatically construct the knowledge graph. We annotate a large amount of assertions for both plausibility and typicality of an intention that can explain a purchasing or co-purchasing behavior, where the intention can be an open reason or a predicate falling into one of 18 categories aligning with ConceptNet, e.g., IsA, MadeOf, UsedFor, etc. Then we populate the annotated information to all automatically generated ones, and further structurize the assertions using pattern mining and conceptualization to form more condensed and abstractive knowledge. We evaluate our knowledge graph using both intrinsic quality measures and a downstream application, i.e., recommendation. The comprehensive study shows that our knowledge graph can well model e-commerce commonsense knowledge and can have many potential applications.","No"

First, we propose novel ensembling methods and show that they substantially reduce variance. Second, since performance depends a lot on the set of few shots selected, active learning is promising for few-shot classification. Based on our stable ensembling method, we build on existing work on active learning and introduce a new criterion: inter-prompt uncertainty sampling with diversity.

However, recent work has found that even saliency methods have weak rank correlations and advocated for the use of alternative diagnostic methods. In our work, we demonstrate that rank correlation is not a good fit for evaluating agreement and argue that Pearson-$r$ is a better suited alternative.

We introduce AutoTemplate, a simple yet effective lexically constrained text generation framework divided into template generation and lexicalization tasks. The template generation is to generate the text with the placeholders, and lexicalization replaces them into the constraint lexicons to perform lexically constrained text generation. We conducted the experiments on two tasks: keywords-to-sentence generations and entity-guided summarization. Experimental results show that the AutoTemplate outperforms the competitive baselines on both tasks while satisfying the hard lexical constraints.","No"

"Large Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge","Nikhil Kandpal, Haikang Deng, Adam Roberts, Eric Wallace, Colin Raffel",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08411","The internet contains a wealth of knowledge -- from the birthdays of historical figures to tutorials on how to code -- all of which may be learned by language models. However, there is a huge variability in the number of times a given piece of information appears on the web. In this paper, we study the relationship between the knowledge memorized by large language models and the information in their pre-training datasets. In particular, we show that a language model's ability to answer a fact-based question relates to how many documents associated with that question were seen during pre-training. We identify these relevant documents by entity linking pre-training datasets and counting documents that contain the same entities as a given question-answer pair. Our results demonstrate strong correlational and causal relationships between accuracy and relevant document count for numerous question answering datasets (e.g., TriviaQA), pre-training corpora (e.g., ROOTS), and model sizes (e.g., 176B parameters). Moreover, we find that while larger models are better at learning long-tail knowledge, we estimate that today's models must be scaled by many orders of magnitude to reach competitive QA performance on questions with little support in the pre-training data. Finally, we show that retrieval-augmentation can reduce the dependence on relevant document count, presenting a promising approach for capturing the long-tail.","No"

To measure whether an LLM prefers factually consistent continuations of its input, we propose a new benchmark called FIB(Factual Inconsistency Benchmark) that focuses on the task of summarization. Specifically, our benchmark involves comparing the scores an LLM assigns to a factually consistent versus a factually inconsistent summary for an input news article. For factually consistent summaries, we use human-written reference summaries that we manually verify as factually consistent. To generate summaries that are factually inconsistent, we generate summaries from a suite of summarization models that we have manually annotated as factually inconsistent. A model's factual consistency is then measured according to its accuracy, i.e.\ the proportion of documents where it assigns a higher score to the factually consistent summary. To validate the usefulness of FIB, we evaluate 23 large language models ranging from 1B to 176B parameters from six different model families including BLOOM and OPT. We find that existing LLMs generally assign a higher score to factually consistent summaries than to factually inconsistent summaries. However, if the factually inconsistent summaries occur verbatim in the document, then LLMs assign a higher score to these factually inconsistent summaries than factually consistent summaries.

"QueryForm: A Simple Zero-shot Form Entity Query Framework","Zifeng Wang, Zizhao Zhang, Jacob Devlin, Chen-Yu Lee, Guolong Su, Hao Zhang, Jennifer Dy, Vincent Perot, Tomas Pfister",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07730","Zero-shot transfer learning for document understanding is a crucial yet under-investigated scenario to help reduce the high cost involved in annotating document entities. We present a novel query-based framework, QueryForm, that extracts entity values from form-like documents in a zero-shot fashion. QueryForm contains a dual prompting mechanism that composes both the document schema and a specific entity type into a query, which is used to prompt a Transformer model to perform a single entity extraction task. Furthermore, we propose to leverage large-scale query-entity pairs generated from form-like webpages with weak HTML annotations to pre-train QueryForm. By unifying pre-training and fine-tuning into the same query-based framework, QueryForm enables models to learn from structured documents containing various entities and layouts, leading to better generalization to target document types without the need for target-specific training data. QueryForm sets new state-of-the-art average F1 score on both the XFUND (+4.6%~10.1%) and the Payment (+3.2%~9.5%) zero-shot benchmark, with a smaller model size and no additional image input.","No"
"Evaluating How Fine-tuning on Bimodal Data Effects Code Generation","Gabriel Orlanski, Seonhye Yang, Michael Healy",11,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07842","Despite the increase in popularity of language models for code generation, it is still unknown how training on bimodal coding forums affects a model's code generation performance and reliability.

Motivated by the effectiveness and robustness of self-attention-based architectures, researchers are turning to using pre-trained Transformers (i.e., foundation models) instead of traditional convolutional neural networks in FL to leverage their excellent transfer learning capabilities. Despite recent progress, how pre-trained Transformer models play a role in FL remains obscure, that is, how to efficiently fine-tune these pre-trained models in FL and how FL users could benefit from this new paradigm. In this paper, we explore this issue and demonstrate that the fine-tuned Transformers achieve extraordinary performance on FL, and that the lightweight fine-tuning method facilitates a fast convergence rate and low communication costs. Concretely, we conduct a rigorous empirical study of three tuning methods (i.e., modifying the input, adding extra modules, and adjusting the backbone) using two types of pre-trained models (i.e., vision-language models and vision models) for FL. Our experiments show that 1) Fine-tuning the bias term of the backbone performs best when relying on a strong pre-trained model; 2) The vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) outperforms the pure vision model (e.g., ViT) and is more robust to the few-shot settings; 3) Compared to pure local training, FL with pre-trained models has a higher accuracy because it alleviates the problem of over-fitting. We will release our code and encourage further exploration of pre-trained Transformers and FL.","No"

Systems with strong VG are considered intuitively interpretable and suggest an improved scene understanding. While VQA accuracy performances have seen impressive gains over the past few years, explicit improvements to VG performance and evaluation thereof have often taken a back seat on the road to overall accuracy improvements. A cause of this originates in the predominant choice of learning paradigm for VQA systems, which consists of training a discriminative classifier over a predetermined set of answer options. In this work, we break with the dominant VQA modeling paradigm of classification and investigate VQA from the standpoint of an information retrieval task. As such, the developed system directly ties VG into its core search procedure. Our system operates over a weighted, directed, acyclic graph, a.k.a. 'lattice', which is derived from the scene graph of a given image in conjunction with region-referring expressions extracted from the question. We give a detailed analysis of our approach and discuss its distinctive properties and limitations.

Whereas recent works primarily focus on mining spatiotemporal information from hand-crafted features, we explore how to model the temporal patterns of speech emotions from dynamic temporal scales. Towards that goal, we introduce a novel temporal emotional modeling approach for SER, termed Temporal-aware bI-direction Multi-scale Network (TIM-Net), which learns multi-scale contextual affective representations from various time scales. Specifically, TIM-Net first employs temporal-aware blocks to learn temporal affective representation, then integrates complementary information from the past and the future to enrich contextual representations, and finally, fuses multiple time scale features for better adaptation to the emotional variation. Extensive experimental results on six benchmark SER datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TIM-Net, gaining 2.34% and 2.61% improvements of the average UAR and WAR over the second-best on each corpus. Remarkably, TIM-Net outperforms the latest domain-adaptation method on the cross-corpus SER tasks, demonstrating strong generalizability.","No"

This paper firstly proposes a language-specific model that extract emotional information from multiple pre-trained speech models, and then designs a multi-domain model that simultaneously performs SER for various languages. Our multidomain model employs a multi-gating mechanism to generate unique weighted feature combination for each language, and also searches for specific neural network structure for each language through a neural architecture search module.

However, these approaches do not consider the uncertainty of the trained policy and simply always execute actions suggested by the current policy as the most probable ones. This makes them vulnerable to domain shift and inefficient in the number of required demonstrations. We extend previous works and present the PARTNR algorithm that can detect ambiguities in the trained policy by analyzing multiple modalities in the pick and place poses using topological analysis. PARTNR employs an adaptive, sensitivity-based, gating function that decides if additional user demonstrations are required. User demonstrations are aggregated to the dataset and used for subsequent training. In this way, the policy can adapt promptly to domain shift and it can minimize the number of required demonstrations for a well-trained policy. The adaptive threshold enables to achieve the user-acceptable level of ambiguity to execute the policy autonomously and in turn, increase the trustworthiness of our system. We demonstrate the performance of PARTNR in a table-top pick and place task.","No"

In addition, it is hard to adapt to the evolving world knowledge without the costly model re-training. In this paper, we develop a novel semi-parametric language model architecture, Knowledge-in-Context (KiC), which empowers a parametric text-to-text language model with a knowledge-rich external memory. Specifically, the external memory contains six different types of knowledge: entity, dictionary, commonsense, event, script, and causality knowledge. For each input instance, the KiC model adaptively selects a knowledge type and retrieves the most helpful pieces of knowledge. The input instance along with its knowledge augmentation is fed into a text-to-text model (e.g., T5) to generate the output answer, where both the input and the output are in natural language forms after prompting. Interestingly, we find that KiC can be identified as a special mixture-of-experts (MoE) model, where the knowledge selector plays the role of a router that is used to determine the sequence-to-expert assignment in MoE. This key observation inspires us to develop a novel algorithm for training KiC with an instance-adaptive knowledge selector. As a knowledge-rich semi-parametric language model, KiC only needs a much smaller parametric part to achieve superior zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. By evaluating on 40+ different tasks, we show that KiC_Large with 770M parameters easily outperforms large language models (LMs) that are 4-39x larger by a large margin. We also demonstrate that KiC exhibits emergent abilities at a much smaller model scale compared to the fully-parametric models.","No"

Although the contrastive learning framework has shown its superiority on sentence representation learning over previous methods, the potential of such a framework is under-explored so far due to the simple method it used to construct positive pairs. Motivated by this, we propose a method that makes hard positives from the original training examples. A pivotal ingredient of our approach is the use of prefix that is attached to a pre-trained language model, which allows for differentiable data augmentation during contrastive learning. Our method can be summarized in two steps: supervised prefix-tuning followed by joint contrastive fine-tuning with unlabeled or labeled examples. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of our data augmentation approach. The proposed method yields significant improvements over existing methods under both semi-supervised and supervised settings. Our experiments under a low labeled data setting also show that our method is more label-efficient than the state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods.","No"

Speech based automatic AD screening systems provide a non-intrusive and more scalable alternative to other clinical screening techniques. Textual embedding features produced by pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as BERT are widely used in such systems. However, PLM domain fine-tuning is commonly based on the masked word or sentence prediction costs that are inconsistent with the back-end AD detection task. To this end, this paper investigates the use of prompt-based fine-tuning of PLMs that consistently uses AD classification errors as the training objective function. Disfluency features based on hesitation or pause filler token frequencies are further incorporated into prompt phrases during PLM fine-tuning.

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), which enables low-bit computations without extra training, could be a promising tool. In this work, we conduct an empirical evaluation of three PTQ methods on BERT-Base and BERT-Large: Linear Quantization (LQ), Analytical Clipping for Integer Quantization (ACIQ), and Outlier Channel Splitting (OCS). OCS theoretically surpasses the others in minimizing the Mean Square quantization Error and avoiding distorting the weights' outliers. That is consistent with the evaluation results of most language tasks of GLUE benchmark and a reading comprehension task, SQuAD.

We further explore the limit of quantization bit and show that OCS could quantize BERT-Base and BERT-Large to 3-bits and retain 98% and 96% of the performance on the GLUE benchmark accordingly. Moreover, we conduct quantization on the whole BERT family, i.e., BERT models in different configurations, and comprehensively evaluate their performance on the GLUE benchmark and SQuAD, hoping to provide valuable guidelines for their deployment in various computation environments.","No"

Despite its simplicity, this approach achieves superior or comparable performance on both topic and sentiment classification datasets and outperforms prior works significantly on unbalanced datasets. We further explore the applicability of our clustering approach by evaluating it on 14 datasets with more diverse topics, text lengths, and numbers of classes.

"XNOR-FORMER: Learning Accurate Approximations in Long Speech Transformers","Roshan Sharma and Bhiksha Raj",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16643","Transformers are among the state of the art for many tasks in speech, vision, and natural language processing, among others. Self-attentions, which are crucial contributors to this performance have quadratic computational complexity, which makes training on longer input sequences challenging. Prior work has produced state-of-the-art transformer variants with linear attention, however, current models sacrifice performance to achieve efficient implementations. In this work, we develop a novel linear transformer by examining the properties of the key-query product within self-attentions. Our model outperforms state of the art approaches on speech recognition and speech summarization, resulting in 1 % absolute WER improvement on the Librispeech-100 speech recognition benchmark and a new INTERVIEW speech recognition benchmark, and 5 points on ROUGE for summarization with How2.","No"
"Learning Dependencies of Discrete Speech Representations with Neural Hidden Markov Models","Sung-Lin Yeh, Hao Tang",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16659","While discrete latent variable models have had great success in self-supervised learning, most models assume that frames are independent. Due to the segmental nature of phonemes in speech perception, modeling dependencies among latent variables at the frame level can potentially improve the learned representations on phonetic-related tasks. In this work, we assume Markovian dependencies among latent variables, and propose to learn speech representations with neural hidden Markov models. Our general framework allows us to compare to self-supervised models that assume independence, while keeping the number of parameters fixed. The added dependencies improve the accessibility of phonetic information, phonetic segmentation, and the cluster purity of phones, showcasing the benefit of the assumed dependencies.","No"

In this work, we perform fine-grained human annotations to evaluate long document abstractive summarization systems (i.e., models and metrics) with the aim of implementing them to generate reliable summaries. For long document abstractive models, we show that the constant strive for state-of-the-art ROUGE results can lead us to generate more relevant summaries but not factual ones. For long document evaluation metrics, human evaluation results show that ROUGE remains the best at evaluating the relevancy of a summary. It also reveals important limitations of factuality metrics in detecting different types of factual errors and the reasons behind the effectiveness of BARTScore. We then suggest promising directions in the endeavor of developing factual consistency metrics. Finally, we release our annotated long document dataset with the hope that it can contribute to the development of metrics across a broader range of summarization settings.","No"
"token2vec: A Joint Self-Supervised Pre-training Framework Using Unpaired Speech and Text","Xianghu Yue and Junyi Ao and Xiaoxue Gao and Haizhou Li",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16755","Self-supervised pre-training has been successful in both text and speech processing. Speech and text offer different but complementary information. The question is whether we are able to perform a speech-text joint pre-training on unpaired speech and text. In this paper, we take the idea of self-supervised pre-training one step further and propose token2vec, a novel joint pre-training framework for unpaired speech and text based on discrete representations of speech. Firstly, due to the distinct characteristics between speech and text modalities, where speech is continuous while text is discrete, we first discretize speech into a sequence of discrete speech tokens to solve the modality mismatch problem. Secondly, to solve the length mismatch problem, where the speech sequence is usually much longer than text sequence, we convert the words of text into phoneme sequences and randomly repeat each phoneme in the sequences. Finally, we feed the discrete speech and text tokens into a modality-agnostic Transformer encoder and pre-train with token-level masking language modeling (tMLM). Experiments show that token2vec is significantly superior to various speech-only pre-training baselines, with up to 17.7% relative WER reduction. Token2vec model is also validated on a non-ASR task, i.e., spoken intent classification, and shows good transferability.","No"

As the pretrained backbone makes a major contribution to the improvement, we naturally expect a good pretrained classification head can also benefit the training. However, the final-layer output of the backbone, i.e. the input of the classification head, will change greatly during finetuning, making the usual head-only pretraining (LP-FT) ineffective. In this paper, we find that parameter-efficient tuning makes a good classification head, with which we can simply replace the randomly initialized heads for a stable performance gain. Our experiments demonstrate that the classification head jointly pretrained with parameter-efficient tuning consistently improves the performance on 9 tasks in GLUE and SuperGLUE.","No"
"An Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks","Yuxiang Wu, Yu Zhao, Baotian Hu, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp and Sebastian Riedel",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16773","Access to external knowledge is essential for many natural language processing tasks, such as question answering and dialogue. Existing methods often rely on a parametric model that stores knowledge in its parameters, or use a retrieval-augmented model that has access to an external knowledge source. Parametric and retrieval-augmented models have complementary strengths in terms of computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. To combine the strength of both approaches, we propose the Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer (EMAT) -- it encodes external knowledge into a key-value memory and exploits the fast maximum inner product search for memory querying. We also introduce pre-training tasks that allow EMAT to encode informative key-value representations, and to learn an implicit strategy to integrate multiple memory slots into the transformer. Experiments on various knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering and dialogue datasets show that, simply augmenting parametric models (T5-base) using our method produces more accurate results (e.g., 25.8 -> 44.3 EM on NQ) while retaining a high throughput (e.g., 1000 queries/s on NQ). Compared to retrieval-augmented models, EMAT runs substantially faster across the board and produces more accurate results on WoW and ELI5.

"Actionable Phrase Detection using NLP","Adit Magotra",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16841","Actionable sentences are terms that, in the most basic sense, imply the necessity of taking a specific action. In Linguistic terms, they are steps to achieve an operation, often through the usage of action verbs. For example, the sentence, `Get your homework finished by tomorrow` qualifies as actionable since it demands a specific action (In this case, finishing homework) to be taken. In contrast, a simple sentence such as, `I like to play the guitar` does not qualify as an actionable phrase since it simply states a personal choice of the person instead of demanding a task to be finished. In this paper, the aim is to explore if Actionables can be extracted from raw text using Linguistic filters designed from scratch. These filters are specially catered to identifying actionable text using Transfer Learning as the lead role. Actionable Detection can be used in detecting emergency tasks during a crisis, Instruction accuracy for First aid and can also be used to make productivity tools like automatic ToDo list generators from conferences. To accomplish this, we use the Enron Email Dataset and apply our Linguistic filters on the cleaned textual data. We then use Transfer Learning with the Universal Sentence Encoder to train a model to classify whether a given string of raw text is actionable or not.","No"

In this paper, we look at large-scale intermediate pre-training of decomposition-based transformers using distant supervision from comparable texts, particularly large-scale parallel news. We show that with such intermediate pre-training, developing robust decomposition-based models for a diverse range of tasks becomes more feasible.

DiffusER is not only a strong generative model in general, rivalling autoregressive models on several tasks spanning machine translation, summarization, and style transfer; it can also perform other varieties of generation that standard autoregressive models are not well-suited for. For instance, we demonstrate that DiffusER makes it possible for a user to condition generation on a prototype, or an incomplete sequence, and continue revising based on previous edit steps.","No"

"Improving Bilingual Lexicon Induction with Cross-Encoder Reranking","Yaoyiran Li, Fangyu Liu, Ivan Vuli\'c, Anna Korhonen",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16953","Bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) with limited bilingual supervision is a crucial yet challenging task in multilingual NLP. Current state-of-the-art BLI methods rely on the induction of cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWEs) to capture cross-lingual word similarities; such CLWEs are obtained 1) via traditional static models (e.g., VecMap), or 2) by extracting type-level CLWEs from multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs), or 3) through combining the former two options. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised post-hoc reranking method termed BLICEr (BLI with Cross-Encoder Reranking), applicable to any precalculated CLWE space, which improves their BLI capability. The key idea is to 'extract' cross-lingual lexical knowledge from mPLMs, and then combine it with the original CLWEs. This crucial step is done via 1) creating a word similarity dataset, comprising positive word pairs (i.e., true translations) and hard negative pairs induced from the original CLWE space, and then 2) fine-tuning an mPLM (e.g., mBERT or XLM-R) in a cross-encoder manner to predict the similarity scores. At inference, we 3) combine the similarity score from the original CLWE space with the score from the BLI-tuned cross-encoder. BLICEr establishes new state-of-the-art results on two standard BLI benchmarks spanning a wide spectrum of diverse languages: it substantially outperforms a series of strong baselines across the board.

While existing model debugging methods have shown promise, their prototype-level implementations provide limited practical utility. Thus, we propose XMD: the first open-source, end-to-end framework for explanation-based model debugging.

This dataset is unique because: (a) each entailment decision requires three inputs: the statement from the will, the law, and the conditions that hold at the time of the testator's death; and (b) the included texts are longer than the ones in current NLI datasets. We trained eight neural NLI models in this dataset. All the models achieve more than 80% macro F1 and accuracy, which indicates that neural approaches can handle this task reasonably well. However, group accuracy, a stricter evaluation measure that is calculated with a group of positive and negative examples generated from the same statement as a unit, is in mid 80s at best, which suggests that the models' understanding of the task remains superficial. Further ablative analyses and explanation experiments indicate that all three text segments are used for prediction, but some decisions rely on semantically irrelevant tokens. This indicates that overfitting on these longer texts likely happens, and that additional research is required for this task to be solved.","No"

The intuition of our method comes from the observation that words are split into subtokens before being fed into the transformer models and the substitution between two close subtokens has a similar effect to the character modification. Our method mainly contains three steps. First, a gradient-based method is adopted to find the most vulnerable words in the sentence. Then we split the selected words into subtokens to replace the origin tokenization result from the transformer tokenizer. Finally, we utilize an adversarial loss to guide the substitution of attachable subtokens in which the Gumbel-softmax trick is introduced to ensure gradient propagation. Meanwhile, we introduce the visual and length constraint in the optimization process to achieve minimum character modifications. Extensive experiments on both sentence-level and token-level tasks demonstrate that our method could outperform the previous attack methods in terms of success rate and edit distance. Furthermore, human evaluation verifies our adversarial examples could preserve their origin labels.","No"

A cause of death (COD) is often determined by a verbal autopsy (VA) report in places without reliable death registration systems. A non-clinician field worker does a VA report using a set of standardized questions as a guide to uncover symptoms of a COD. This analysis focuses on the textual part of the VA report as a case study to address the challenge of adapting NLP techniques in the health domain. We present a system that relies on two transfer learning paradigms of monolingual learning and multi-source domain adaptation to improve VA narratives for the target task of the COD classification. We use the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo) models pre-trained on the general English and health domains to extract features from the VA narratives. Our findings suggest that this transfer learning system improves the COD classification tasks and that the narrative text contains valuable information for figuring out a COD. Our results further show that combining binary VA features and narrative text features learned via this framework boosts the classification task of COD.","No"
"Reduce Catastrophic Forgetting of Dense Retrieval Training with Teleportation Negatives","Si Sun, Chenyan Xiong, Yue Yu, Arnold Overwijk, Zhiyuan Liu, Jie Bao",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17167","In this paper, we investigate the instability in the standard dense retrieval training, which iterates between model training and hard negative selection using the being-trained model. We show the catastrophic forgetting phenomena behind the training instability, where models learn and forget different negative groups during training iterations. We then propose ANCE-Tele, which accumulates momentum negatives from past iterations and approximates future iterations using lookahead negatives, as 'teleportations' along the time axis to smooth the learning process. On web search and OpenQA, ANCE-Tele outperforms previous state-of-the-art systems of similar size, eliminates the dependency on sparse retrieval negatives, and is competitive among systems using significantly more (50x) parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that teleportation negatives reduce catastrophic forgetting and improve convergence speed for dense retrieval training.

"SDCL: Self-Distillation Contrastive Learning for Chinese Spell Checking","Xiaotian Zhang, Hang Yan, Sun Yu, Xipeng Qiu",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17168","Due to the ambiguity of homophones, Chinese Spell Checking (CSC) has widespread applications. Existing systems typically utilize BERT for text encoding. However, CSC requires the model to account for both phonetic and graphemic information. To adapt BERT to the CSC task, we propose a token-level self-distillation contrastive learning method. We employ BERT to encode both the corrupted and corresponding correct sentence. Then, we use contrastive learning loss to regularize corrupted tokens' hidden states to be closer to counterparts in the correct sentence. On three CSC datasets, we confirmed our method provides a significant improvement above baselines.","No"

Our system for this task uses XLM-R to predict probabilities for the target tweet to use each of the techniques. In addition to finding the techniques, Subtask 2 further asks to identify the textual span for each instance of each technique that is present in the tweet; the task can be modeled as a sequence tagging problem. We use a multi-granularity network with mBERT encoder for Subtask 2. Overall, our system ranks second for both subtasks (out of 14 and 3 participants, respectively).

"50 Ways to Bake a Cookie: Mapping the Landscape of Procedural Texts","Moran Mizrahi, Dafna Shahaf",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17235","The web is full of guidance on a wide variety of tasks, from changing the oil in your car to baking an apple pie.

In this work we propose an unsupervised learning approach for summarizing multiple procedural texts into an intuitive graph representation, allowing users to easily explore commonalities and differences. We demonstrate our approach on recipes, a prominent example of procedural texts. User studies show that our representation is intuitive and coherent and that it has the potential to help users with several sensemaking tasks, including adapting recipes for a novice cook and finding creative ways to spice up a dish.","No"
"Pneg: Prompt-based Negative Response Generation for Dialogue Response Selection Task","Nyoungwoo Lee, ChaeHun Park, Ho-Jin Choi, and Jaegul Choo",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17238","In retrieval-based dialogue systems, a response selection model acts as a ranker to select the most appropriate response among several candidates. However, such selection models tend to rely on context-response content similarity, which makes models vulnerable to adversarial responses that are semantically similar but not relevant to the dialogue context. Recent studies have shown that leveraging these adversarial responses as negative training samples is useful for improving the discriminating power of the selection model. Nevertheless, collecting human-written adversarial responses is expensive, and existing synthesizing methods often have limited scalability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a simple but efficient method for generating adversarial negative responses leveraging a large-scale language model. Experimental results on dialogue selection tasks show that our method outperforms other methods of synthesizing adversarial negative responses. These results suggest that our method can be an effective alternative to human annotators in generating adversarial responses.

However, the formulation of the task is rather ambiguous, neither the linguistic nor the natural language processing community has succeeded in giving a mutually agreed-upon definition. Due to this lack of well-defined formulation, a large number of popular abstractive summarization datasets are constructed in a manner that neither guarantees validity nor meets one of the most essential criteria of summarization: factual consistency. In this paper, we address this issue by combining state-of-the-art factual consistency models to identify the problematic instances present in popular summarization datasets. We release SummFC, a filtered summarization dataset with improved factual consistency, and demonstrate that models trained on this dataset achieve improved performance in nearly all quality aspects. We argue that our dataset should become a valid benchmark for developing and evaluating summarization systems.","No"

First, SSD-LM is semi-autoregressive, iteratively generating blocks of text, allowing for flexible output length at decoding time while enabling local bidirectional context updates. Second, it is simplex-based, performing diffusion on the natural vocabulary space rather than a learned latent space, allowing us to incorporate classifier guidance and modular control without any adaptation of off-the-shelf classifiers. We evaluate SSD-LM on unconstrained as well as controlled text generation benchmarks, and show that it matches or outperforms strong autoregressive GPT-2 baselines across standard quality and diversity metrics.","No"

Little work has been done at the fine-grained semantic level (or contextual level). For example, given that we know Elon Musk is the CEO of a technology company, the sentence 'Elon Musk acted in the sitcom The Big Bang Theory' is novel and surprising because normally a CEO would not be an actor. Existing topic-based novelty detection methods work poorly on this problem because they do not perform semantic reasoning involving relations between named entities in the text and their background knowledge. This paper proposes an effective model (called PAT-SND) to solve the problem, which can also characterize the novelty. An annotated dataset is also created. Evaluation shows that PAT-SND outperforms 10 baselines by large margins.","No"

To address this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques were introduced where small trainable components are injected in the PLM and updated during fine-tuning. We propose AdaMix as a general PEFT method that tunes a mixture of adaptation modules -- given the underlying PEFT method of choice -- introduced in each Transformer layer while keeping most of the PLM weights frozen. For instance, AdaMix can leverage a mixture of adapters like Houlsby or a mixture of low rank decomposition matrices like LoRA to improve downstream task performance over the corresponding PEFT methods for fully supervised and few-shot NLU and NLG tasks. Further, we design AdaMix such that it matches the same computational cost and the number of tunable parameters as the underlying PEFT method. By only tuning 0.1-0.2% of PLM parameters, we show that AdaMix outperforms SOTA parameter-efficient fine-tuning and full model fine-tuning for both NLU and NLG tasks.","No"

Most non-synthetic code-mixed data are from social media but gathering a significant amount of this kind of data would be laborious and this form of data has more writing variation than other domains, so for both subtasks, we experimented with data schedules for out-of-domain data. We jointly learn multiple domains of text by pretraining and fine-tuning, combined with a sentence alignment objective. We found that switching between domains caused improved performance in the domains seen earliest during training, but depleted the performance on the remaining domains. A continuous training run with strategically dispensed data of different domains showed a significantly improved performance over fine-tuning.","No"
"Chronic pain patient narratives allow for the estimation of current pain intensity","Diogo A.P. Nunes, Joana Ferreira-Gomes, Carlos Vaz, Daniela Oliveira, Sofia Pimenta, Fani Neto and David Martins de Matos",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17473","Chronic pain is a multi-dimensional experience, and pain intensity plays an important part, impacting the patients emotional balance, psychology, and behaviour. Standard self-reporting tools, such as the Visual Analogue Scale for pain, fail to capture these impacts. Moreover, these tools are susceptible to a degree of subjectivity, dependent on the patients clear understanding of how to use them, social biases, and their ability to translate a complex experience to a scale. To overcome these and other self-reporting challenges, pain intensity estimation has been previously studied based on facial expressions, electroencephalograms, brain imaging, and autonomic features. However, to the best of our knowledge, it has never been attempted to base this estimation on the patient narratives of the personal experience of chronic pain, which is what we propose in this work. Indeed, in the clinical assessment and management of chronic pain, verbal communication is essential to convey information to physicians that would otherwise not be easily accessible through standard reporting tools, since language, sociocultural, and psychosocial variables are intertwined. We show that language features from patient narratives indeed convey information relevant for pain intensity estimation, and that our computational models can take advantage of that. Specifically, our results show that patients with mild pain focus more on the use of verbs, whilst moderate and severe pain patients focus on adverbs, and nouns and adjectives, respectively, and that these differences allow for the distinction between these three pain classes.","No"

Such questions tend to be multifaceted, i.e., they may have ambiguities and/or require information from multiple sources. To this end, we define query refinement prompts that encourage LLMs to explicitly express the multifacetedness in questions and generate long-form answers covering multiple facets of the question.

We show that fine-tuning the zero-shot classifier on its most confident predictions leads to significant performance gains across a wide range of text classification tasks, presumably since self-training adapts the zero-shot model to the task at hand.","No"
"DiMBERT: Learning Vision-Language Grounded Representations with Disentangled Multimodal-Attention","Fenglin Liu, Xian Wu, Shen Ge, Xuancheng Ren, Wei Fan, Xu Sun, Yuexian Zou",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16431","Vision-and-language (V-L) tasks require the system to understand both vision content and natural language, thus learning fine-grained joint representations of vision and language (a.k.a. V-L representations) is of paramount importance. Recently, various pre-trained V-L models are proposed to learn V-L representations and achieve improved results in many tasks. However, the mainstream models process both vision and language inputs with the same set of attention matrices. As a result, the generated V-L representations are entangled in one common latent space. To tackle this problem, we propose DiMBERT (short for Disentangled Multimodal-Attention BERT), which is a novel framework that applies separated attention spaces for vision and language, and the representations of multi-modalities can thus be disentangled explicitly. To enhance the correlation between vision and language in disentangled spaces, we introduce the visual concepts to DiMBERT which represent visual information in textual format. In this manner, visual concepts help to bridge the gap between the two modalities. We pre-train DiMBERT on a large amount of image-sentence pairs on two tasks: bidirectional language modeling and sequence-to-sequence language modeling. After pre-train, DiMBERT is further fine-tuned for the downstream tasks. Experiments show that DiMBERT sets new state-of-the-art performance on three tasks (over four datasets), including both generation tasks (image captioning and visual storytelling) and classification tasks (referring expressions). The proposed DiM (short for Disentangled Multimodal-Attention) module can be easily incorporated into existing pre-trained V-L models to boost their performance, up to a 5% increase on the representative task. Finally, we conduct a systematic analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of our DiM and the introduced visual concepts.","No"

We also show that this frame reduction operation can be applied in the middle of the encoder, which result in significant speed up for the training and inference in RNN-T. We further show that the CTC alignment, a by-product of the CTC decoder, can also be used to perform lattice reduction for RNN-T during training. Our method is evaluated on the Librispeech and SpeechStew tasks.

Accordingly, models that have been proposed for emotion detection use one or the other of these label types. However, psychologists like Russell and Plutchik have proposed theories and models that unite these views, maintaining that these representations have shared and complementary information. This paper is an attempt to validate these viewpoints computationally. To this end, we propose a model to jointly predict continuous and discrete emotional attributes and show how the relationship between these can be utilized to improve the robustness and performance of emotion recognition tasks. Our approach comprises multi-task and hierarchical multi-task learning frameworks that jointly model the relationships between continuous-valued and discrete emotion labels. Experimental results on two widely used datasets (IEMOCAP and MSPPodcast) for speech-based emotion recognition show that our model results in statistically significant improvements in performance over strong baselines with non-unified approaches. We also demonstrate that using one type of label (discrete or continuous-valued) for training improves recognition performance in tasks that use the other type of label. Experimental results and reasoning for this approach (called the mismatched training approach) are also presented.","No"

This mechanism encourages a model to learn inner/inter-dependencies between the audio and token representations while maintaining CTC's training efficiency. During inference, BERT-CTC combines a mask-predict algorithm with CTC decoding, which iteratively refines an output sequence. The experimental results reveal that BERT-CTC improves over conventional approaches across variations in speaking styles and languages. Finally, we show that the semantic representations in BERT-CTC are beneficial towards downstream spoken language understanding tasks.","No"

On the other hand, Indian languages share a lot of common sounds. Common Label Set (CLS) exploits this idea and maps graphemes of various languages with similar sounds to common labels. Since Indian languages are mostly phonetic, building a parser to convert from native script to CLS is easy. In this paper, we explore various approaches to build multilingual ASR models. We also propose a novel architecture called Encoder-Decoder-Decoder for building multilingual systems that use both CLS and native script labels.

Inherited from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, the architecture takes Layer Normalization~(LN) as a default normalization technique. However, through a series of systematic studies, we find that LN might take 10\% of the inference time despite that it only contributes to 0.1\% of the FLOPs. This motivates us to replace LN with other normalization techniques, e.g., Batch Normalization~(BN), to speed up inference with the help of operator fusion methods and the avoidance of calculating the mean and variance statistics during inference. After examining several plain attempts which directly remove all LN layers or replace them with BN in the same place, we find that the divergence issue is mainly caused by the unstable layer output. We therefore propose to append a BN layer to each linear or convolution layer where stabilized training results are observed. We also propose to simplify the activations in Conformer, such as Swish and GLU, by replacing them with ReLU. All these exchanged modules can be fused into the weights of the adjacent linear/convolution layers and hence have zero inference cost. Therefore, we name it FusionFormer.

Inspired by MixGen, which is originally applied to vision-language learning, we introduce an augmentation method for the audio-language domain. We also explore the impact of test-time augmentations and present Multi-TTA which generalizes test-time augmentation over multiple layers of a deep learning model. Incorporating AL-MixGen and Multi-TTA into the baseline achieves 47.5 SPIDEr on audio captioning, which is an +18.2% over the baseline and outperforms the state-of-the-art approach with a 5x smaller model. In audio-text retrieval, the proposed methods surpass the baseline performance as well.","No"
"The Effect of Multiple Replies for Natural Language Generation Chatbots","Eason Chen",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17209","In this research, by responding to users' utterances with multiple replies to create a group chat atmosphere, we alleviate the problem that Natural Language Generation chatbots might reply with inappropriate content, thus causing a bad user experience. Because according to our findings, users tend to pay attention to appropriate replies and ignore inappropriate replies. We conducted a 2 (single reply vs. five replies) x 2 (anonymous avatar vs. anime avatar) repeated measures experiment to compare the chatting experience in different conditions. The result shows that users will have a better chatting experience when receiving multiple replies at once from the NLG model compared to the single reply. Furthermore, according to the effect size of our result, to improve the chatting experience for NLG chatbots which is single reply and anonymous avatar, providing five replies will have more benefits than setting an anime avatar.","No"
"When Language Model Meets Private Library","Daoguang Zan, Bei Chen, Zeqi Lin, Bei Guan, Yongji Wang, Jian-Guang Lou",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17236","With the rapid development of pre-training techniques, a number of language models have been pre-trained on large-scale code corpora and perform well in code generation. In this paper, we investigate how to equip pre-trained language models with the ability of code generation for private libraries. In practice, it is common for programmers to write code using private libraries. However, this is a challenge for language models since they have never seen private APIs during training. Motivated by the fact that private libraries usually come with elaborate API documentation, we propose a novel framework with two modules: the APIRetriever finds useful APIs, and then the APICoder generates code using these APIs. For APIRetriever, we present a dense retrieval system and also design a friendly interaction to involve uses. For APICoder, we can directly use off-the-shelf language models, or continually pre-train the base model on a code corpus containing API information. Both modules are trained with data from public libraries and can be generalized to private ones. Furthermore, we craft three benchmarks for private libraries, named TorchDataEval, MonkeyEval, and BeatNumEval. Experimental results demonstrate the impressive performance of our framework.","No"
"Cross-lingual Text-To-Speech with Flow-based Voice Conversion for Improved Pronunciation","Nikolaos Ellinas, Georgios Vamvoukakis, Konstantinos Markopoulos, Georgia Maniati, Panos Kakoulidis, June Sig Sung, Inchul Hwang, Spyros Raptis, Aimilios Chalamandaris, Pirros Tsiakoulis",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17264","This paper presents a method for end-to-end cross-lingual text-to-speech (TTS) which aims to preserve the target language's pronunciation regardless of the original speaker's language. The model used is based on a non-attentive Tacotron architecture, where the decoder has been replaced with a normalizing flow network conditioned on the speaker identity, allowing both TTS and voice conversion (VC) to be performed by the same model due to the inherent linguistic content and speaker identity disentanglement. When used in a cross-lingual setting, acoustic features are initially produced with a native speaker of the target language and then voice conversion is applied by the same model in order to convert these features to the target speaker's voice. We verify through objective and subjective evaluations that our method can have benefits compared to baseline cross-lingual synthesis. By including speakers averaging 7.5 minutes of speech, we also present positive results on low-resource scenarios.","No"
"There is more than one kind of robustness: Fooling Whisper with adversarial examples","Raphael Olivier and Bhiksha Raj",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17316","Whisper is a recent Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model displaying impressive robustness to both out-of-distribution inputs and random noise. In this work, we show that this robustness does not carry over to adversarial noise. We generate very small input perturbations with Signal Noise Ratio of up to 45dB, with which we can degrade Whisper performance dramatically, or even transcribe a target sentence of our choice. We also show that by fooling the Whisper language detector we can very easily degrade the performance of multilingual models. These vulnerabilities of a widely popular open-source model have practical security implications, and emphasize the need for adversarially robust ASR.","No"
"Emergent Linguistic Structures in Neural Networks are Fragile","Emanuele La Malfa and Matthew Wicker and Marta Kiatkowska",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17406","Large language models (LLMs) have been reported to have strong performance on natural language processing tasks. However, performance metrics such as accuracy do not measure the quality of the model in terms of its ability to robustly represent complex linguistic structure. Further, the sheer size of LLMs makes it difficult to analyse them using standard robustness evaluation methods. In this work, we propose a framework to evaluate the robustness of linguistic representations using probing tasks. We argue that a robust linguistic model is one that is able to robustly and efficiently represent complex syntactic structure underlying the data distribution and propose appropriate robustness measures. We leverage recent advances in extracting emergent linguistic constructs from LLMs and apply syntax-preserving perturbations to test the stability of these constructs in order to better understand the representations learned by LLMs. Empirically, we study the performance of four LLMs across six different corpora on the proposed robustness measures. We provide evidence that context-free representation (e.g., GloVE) are in some cases competitive with context-dependent representations from modern LLMs (e.g., BERT), yet equally brittle to syntax-preserving manipulations. Emergent syntactic representations in neural networks are brittle, thus our work poses the attention on the risk of comparing such structures to those that are object of a long lasting debate in linguistics.","No"
"Learning New Tasks from a Few Examples with Soft-Label Prototypes","Avyav Kumar Singh, Ekaterina Shutova and Helen Yannakoudakis",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17437","It has been experimentally demonstrated that humans are able to learn in a manner that allows them to make predictions on categories for which they have not seen any examples (Malaviya et al., 2022). Sucholutsky and Schonlau (2020) have recently presented a machine learning approach that aims to do the same. They utilise synthetically generated data and demonstrate that it is possible to achieve sub-linear scaling and develop models that can learn to recognise N classes from M training samples where M is less than N - aka less-than-one shot learning. Their method was, however, defined for univariate or simple multivariate data (Sucholutsky et al., 2021). We extend it to work on large, high-dimensional and real-world datasets and empirically validate it in this new and challenging setting. We apply this method to learn previously unseen NLP tasks from very few examples (4, 8 or 16). We first generate compact, sophisticated less-than-one shot representations called soft-label prototypes which are fitted on training data, capturing the distribution of different classes across the input domain space. We then use a modified k-Nearest Neighbours classifier to demonstrate that soft-label prototypes can classify data competitively, even outperforming much more computationally complex few-shot learning methods.","No"
"Preventing Verbatim Memorization in Language Models Gives a False Sense of Privacy","Daphne Ippolito, Florian Tram\`er, Milad Nasr, Chiyuan Zhang, Matthew Jagielski, Katherine Lee, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Nicholas Carlini",10,2022,"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17546","Studying data memorization in neural language models helps us understand the risks (e.g., to privacy or copyright) associated with models regurgitating training data, and aids in the evaluation of potential countermeasures. Many prior works -- and some recently deployed defenses -- focus on 'verbatim memorization', defined as a model generation that exactly matches a substring from the training set. We argue that verbatim memorization definitions are too restrictive and fail to capture more subtle forms of memorization. Specifically, we design and implement an efficient defense based on Bloom filters that perfectly prevents all verbatim memorization. And yet, we demonstrate that this 'perfect' filter does not prevent the leakage of training data. Indeed, it is easily circumvented by plausible and minimally modified 'style-transfer' prompts -- and in some cases even the non-modified original prompts -- to extract memorized information. For example, instructing the model to output ALL-CAPITAL texts bypasses memorization checks based on verbatim matching. We conclude by discussing potential alternative definitions and why defining memorization is a difficult yet crucial open question for neural language models.","No"
