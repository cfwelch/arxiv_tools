If you have a bunch of unread arXiv updates, you can download them as EML files and put them in the emls folder. Then you can run the read_arxiv.py to extract newly listed articles and cross-listings as a CSV that is importable to Notion.

In gmail you can download emls individually from within the email, or you can select the emails you want to download, forward them to yourself as an attachment, then download them in bulk as a zip and extract them to the emls folder.

The script skips papers that were replaced and ignores email headers.
